''from the [https://nabci-us.org/resources/bird-conservation-regions-map/#bcr27 US NABCI] website:''

This region includes extensive riverine swamps and marsh complexes along the Atlantic Coast. Interior forest vegetation is dominated by longleaf, slash, and loblolly pine forests. Priority landbirds include the [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]], [[Painted Bunting]], [[Bachman's Sparrow]], [[Swainson's Warbler]], and [[Swallow-Tailed Kite]]. Coastal intertidal habitats provide critical wintering areas for American Oystercatcher, important wintering and spring migration areas for Short-billed Dowitcher and Dunlin, and important fall staging areas for Red Knot. Sizable numbers of [[Brown Pelican]]s and various terns breed on offshore islands. Coastal areas provide important nesting and foraging habitats for large numbers of herons, egrets, ibis, terns, and other species. Coastal areas winter large numbers of [[Canvasback]], [[Mallard]], [[American Wigeon]], [[Redhead]], and the majority of the continentâ€™s population of Tundra Swans. Managed impoundments in coastal areas are important to migrating and wintering dabbling ducks, including [[American Black Duck]].
