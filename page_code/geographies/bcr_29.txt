''from the [https://nabci-us.org/resources/bird-conservation-regions-map/#bcr29 US NABCI] website:''

The Piedmont is transitional between the mountainous Appalachians and the flat coastal plain and is dominated by pine and mixed southern hardwoods. Priority landbirds include [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]], [[Bachman's Sparrow]], and [[Brown-headed Nuthatch]]. Interior wetlands, reservoirs, and riverine systems provide migration and wintering habitat for waterfowl and some shorebirds. The fragmented patchwork of pasture, woodlots, and suburban sprawl that now dominates most of this region creates significant bird conservation challenges.
