A Coalition for Integrated Bird Conservation: Established in 1999, the U.S. North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) Committee is a coalition of state and federal government agencies, private organizations, and bird initiatives in the United States working to ensure the long-term health of North Americaâ€™s native bird populations. The U.S. NABCI Committee creates a unique forum for federal and state agencies and non-governmental organizations to address shared bird conservation challenges and priorities. Its strength lies in its ability to directly engage conservation leaders and to collaboratively develop and express a collective voice that promotes integrated all-bird conservation. Individuals who serve on the U.S. NABCI Committee build working relationships across the bird conservation community, contributing their expertise and insights to mutually beneficial goals. Collaborative efforts are aimed at the U.S. and tri-national bird conservation communities and inform and highlight new frontiers in bird conservation.

'''Vision:''' Healthy and abundant populations of North American birds are valued by future generations and sustained by habitats that benefit birds and people.

'''Mission:''' The U.S. NABCI Committee facilitates collaborative partnerships that advance biological, social, and scientific priorities for North American bird conservation.

'''Value Proposition:''' Facilitates advancements in all-bird conservation and works tri-nationally to encompass the full-life-cycle needs of resident and migratory birds. U.S. NABCI work is rooted in both natural and social sciences, focused on the scale of continental bird conservation initiatives and migratory bird joint ventures, and advanced by partnerships that leverage resources and expertise.
