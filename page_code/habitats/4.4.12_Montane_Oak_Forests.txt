=Description=
<p>Montane oak forests are found primarily in the Mountain ecoregion and once included a large component of American Chestnut, before the blight in the early part of the century eliminated it as a canopy species. The driest sites are dominated by Chestnut Oak and/or Scarlet Oak, often with an understory of Sourwood, Black Gum, and Red Maple. Today, chestnut persists only as short-lived sprouts from old root systems. Most of the four natural community types recognized within this ecosystem group are broad types with many variants that could be recognized: Chestnut Oak forests, montane oak–hickory forests, high-elevation Red Oak forests, and montane White Oak forests:
*Chestnut oak forests occur in the driest sites in low to intermediate elevation steep slopes and sharp ridges. Chestnut Oak or Scarlet Oak are the dominant trees, and an understory of acid-loving plants is usually present.
*Montane oak–hickory forests are dominated by a mixture of oaks, of which White Oak is a prominent part. Hickories are usually a minority component, but are sometimes absent. The understory is generally more diverse than in the other oak forests.
*High-elevation Red Oak forests occur at medium to high elevations. In the southern part of the state, where spruce–fir forests are absent and northern hardwoods rare, they may dominate the highest ridges and summits. Farther north, they occur below these communities, often in broad zones along mountain slopes. The canopy is usually nearly pure Northern Red Oak. The lower layers of vegetation vary greatly, but share many species with northern hardwood forests.
*Montane White Oak forests occur at fairly high elevations. They are dominated by White Oak with few other trees.</p>
<p>The 2005 WAP describes this habitat type as Southern Blue Ridge oak forest (including mixed hardwoods and pine) (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>
=Location of Habitat=
<p>Montane oak forests occur in the Mountain ecoregion on exposed sites such as ridge crests and southto west-facing slopes, typically from about 3,000 to 4,500 feet elevation. According to the most recent Southeast GAP analysis, montane oak forest communities comprise over 272 thousand acres (about 110 thousand hectares) of land cover in North Carolina (SEGAP 2007; NatureServe 2007). This represents less than 1% of the state’s land cover.</p>
=Problems Affecting Habitats=
<p>It is unclear if changes in fire regime will be beneficial or harmful to oak forests. Fire suppression has allowed non-fire-tolerant species, including tree species, to increase in montane oak forests. Many oak forests have seen a lack of oak regeneration that is likely related to lack of fire. If a warmer climate brought  an increase in fire, it might offset some of the alterations caused by suppression of fire. Severe fires during droughts would cause extensive canopy mortality and be destructive to oak forests, especially if occurring with the increased fuel loads resulting from recent fire suppression.</p><p>Prolonged or severe drought stress has been associated with oak decline and with canopy mortality. Chestnut blight caused dramatic compositional shift by almost extirpating
the American Chestnut. Some more southern or low-elevation species may migrate into these communities. Impacts from higher temperatures, drought, fire, and wind damage will likely lead to other community types, or different suites of species, more suited to the change in climate due to competitive interactions of species in the seed bank during succession. Unfortunately, this may lead to a greater need for nonnative invasive species control after stand replacing disturbances, natural or man-made.</p><p>Homogeneity of stand age has resulted  in decreasing habitat  for bird species that rely on diverse understory development (lack of understory development). Increased wind damage, fire damage, and drought mortality will result in more canopy gaps and a younger average tree age, but may benefit some herbaceous species.</p><p>Drought may allow pine forests to expand at the expense of oak forests, it will also allow oak forests to expand to higher elevations and into more mesic sites now occupied by cove forests. The overall extent of oak forests may increase moderately. These communities should be able to move to higher elevations, while they are unlikely to lose much acreage at lower elevations.</p><p>Princess Tree and Tree-of-heaven are threats. Gypsy Moths and exotic tree diseases (sudden oak death, chestnut blight) are potential future threats. Fire Ants may be able to invade these communities and cause significant impacts if temperatures become warm enough.</p>
=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=
<p>Comparing climate change to other ecosystem threats can help define shortand long-term conservation actions and recommendations. Montane oak forests will likely be resilient to the effects of climate change and are expected to continue to occupy most of the sites they currently occur in and to remain the most abundant communities. Development remains the most severe threat to these communities.</p>
=Impacts to Wildlife=
<p>No endemic species are associated with montane oak forests. Only three moths associated with this ecosystem group appear to be major disjuncts. Montane species adapted to cooler high-elevation sites may become locally extinct in the lower elevations of their range as temperature gradients change (DeWan et al. 2010).</p><p>Many species (e.g., [[Black-capped Chickadee]]s, [[Green Salamander]]s, [[Seepage Salamander]]s, [[Crevice Salamander]]s, and [[Wehrle’s Salamander]]s) have such a small range or clumped distribution within North Carolina that they are more susceptible to stochastic or genetic population declines or local extirpations than anticipated climate change impacts. [[Timber Rattlesnakes]] and other snake species are also subjected to persecution, which is an immediate threat.</p><p>Many neotropical migrant birds may also be experiencing winter range habitat  loss. Since there is such abundance and diversity of species associated with oak forests, we may not know the exact habitat  or life history requirements of individual species that are limiting factors to their population stability.</p>
