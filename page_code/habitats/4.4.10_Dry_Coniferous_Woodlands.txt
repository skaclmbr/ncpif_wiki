=Description=
<p>The vast majority of land in the Piedmont and Mountain ecoregions is dominated by hardwood forests. Less common are dry coniferous forests, which occur at middle to lower elevations in several kinds of specialized sites that are drier than most environments. They occur primarily in the Mountains and are found in a few mountain-like sites in the Piedmont. Piedmont Longleaf Pine forests, although dominated by coniferous trees, are included with the more closely related [[Dry Longleaf Pine Communities|dry Longleaf Pine forests]] ecosystem group rather than here. There are four community types associated with this ecosystem: pine–oak/ heath, Carolina Hemlock bluffs, White Pine forests, and montane Red Cedar hardwood woodlands.
*The pine–oak/heath community occurs on sharp ridge tops and spur ridges, where shallow soils and exposure to drying winds and lightning prevent development of a closed hardwood forest. Extremely acidic soils, created by leaching and by the acidity of plant leaf litter, may also be a factor. The canopy, typically composed of Pitch, Table Mountain, and/or Virginia pines, is generally open with a dense, tall shrub layer dominated by Mountain Laurel or rhododendron occurring beneath the canopy. Herbs are few and sparse, but characteristic acid-loving species often occur in openings among the shrubs.
*Carolina Hemlock bluffs occur in settings similar to pine–oak/heath, but usually more on steep bluff-like side slopes. Carolina Hemlock dominates the canopy with a shrub and herb layer similar to pine–oak/heath but possibly more open.
*White pine forests are poorly understood communities. While White Pine is a common successional tree in mountain hardwood forests, natural forests of it most typically occur on the walls of steep gorges.
*Montane red cedar-hardwood woodland occurs on shallow soils on gentle slopes. Smooth rock outcrops are usually found in association with it. These woodlands have an open canopy with patchy shrubs and grassy openings. A number of the species suggest that the soils are less acidic than typical mountain soils.</p>
<p>Dry coniferous  woodlands of the Piedmont and Mountain ecoregions are described as priority habitats in the 2005 WAP (see Chapter 5) (NCWRC 2005).</p>
=Location of Habitat=
<p>These communities occur through the lower to middle elevations, the foothills, and are particularly abundant in the escarpment in the Mountain ecoregion. Pilot Mountain, Hanging Rock, and Crowders Mountain State Parks all have examples of the pine–oak/ heath community. Owing to the relatively low-elevations occupied by dry coniferous  forests in the region, significant amounts of this habitat  occur in western North Carolina upon state-owned lands (Thurmond Chatham, South Mountains, and Green River Game Lands; South Mountains State Park; Dupont State Forest).</p>
=Problems Affecting Habitats=
<p>Most dry coniferous  woodlands depend on a combination of fire behavior and dry soils, both driven by topography. However, an increase in extreme fires may be detrimental. Increased drought may increase southern pine beetle outbreaks, a major threat to the pine canopy. Fire suppression has caused these habitats to shrink in recent decades. Increased drought may favor pines over hardwoods and allow them to regain some of their lost area even without fire. Increased drought and fire may allow expansion. These communities occur in the driest mountain and foothill sites, and increasingly dry climate may allow them to expand into a broader range of topography and to higher elevations.</p><p>The structural effects caused by fire suppression and southern pine beetles greatly exceed any effect likely from climate change. The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid has already impacted some stands of Carolina Hemlock, though not to the devastating effect as seen in Canada Hemlock stands. Restoration of the structure, composition, and, most importantly, disturbance regimes of these communities will increase their resilience to environmental stressors. Without fire to promote pine regeneration, increased Pine Beetle mortality could hasten the shift from pines to hardwoods.</p><p>Warmer temperatures should allow spreading to higher elevation, but the acreage gain is likely to be limited. It may not occur if fires are suppressed. Increased wind damage may increase loss of mature pines and contribute to ongoing encroachment of hardwoods. Because the characteristic plants are drought tolerant as well as fire tolerant, an increase in drought may help them retain or regain dominance. In addition, if drought contributes to an increase in wildfire, this may benefit these communities.</p>
=Climate Change Compared to Other Threats=
<p>The most significant threats vary among the different community types. Piedmont and mountain dry coniferous  forests will likely be resilient to the effects of climate change and may actually benefit from increased fire frequency and drought. Lack of fire is the greatest threat to the majority of remaining pine–oak/heath. Not only will these forests not be able to reproduce themselves without fire, but those stands at higher elevations which are not regularly burned often develop dense Mountain Laurel/rhododendron understories that shade out other shrubs and herbaceous plants, thus lowering the habitat  quality and diversity of wildlife which could utilize the area. Management efforts by multiple agencies to increase prescribed fire in fire adapted communities, including dry coniferous forests, are already positioning these communities for greater resilience.
=Impacts to Wildlife=
<p>While [[Red-cockaded Woodpecker]]s are almost exclusively associated with Longleaf Pine systems, most animals that are associated with pines and other dry conifers also occur in mixed stands of hardwoods and conifers. Brown-headed Nuthatches and Chuck-willswidows are also associated with dry woodlands and/or heathlands more generally.</p><p>Additional problems faced by individual species associated with dry coniferous  forest include the lack of early successional habitat  of this type or conversion of this habitat  to other pine habitat (i.e., White Pine) for species such as [[Prairie Warbler]]s, woodpeckers, and nuthatches. [[Timber Rattlesnake]] persecution in these habitats also remains a significant problem. Lack of management of the stands decreases the quality of habitat for woodland hawks by decreasing prey abundance and limiting their ability to hunt in dense understory growth.</p><p>The two species of moths that feed on Bear Oak have a highly confined distribution in North Carolina (as does their host plant). While climate change may create conditions such as increased fire that may favor the oak, the moths are likely to be highly vulnerable to extirpation if fires completely consume all available habitat  in the few areas where the moth currently exists.</p>
