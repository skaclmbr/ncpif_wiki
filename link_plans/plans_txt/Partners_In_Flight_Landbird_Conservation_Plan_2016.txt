FOREWORD: A NEW CALL TO ACTION


The Partners in Flight (PIF) 2016 Landbird  Conservation Plan Revision comes at an important time in conserving our heritage of an abundant and diverse avifauna. There  is now an urgent need to bridge the gap  between bird conservation planning and implementation.

Birds and their habitats face unprecedented threats from climate  change, poorly planned urban  growth,  unsustainable agriculture and forestry, and
a widespread decline in habitat quantity and quality. The spectacle of bird migration is being diminished by direct  mortality as every year millions
of birds die from anthropogenic sources. As documented in this Plan, nearly 20% of U.S. and Canadian landbird species are on a path  towards endangerment and extinction in the absence of conservation action.

We know, however, that when we use the best science to develop conservation plans—and implement them—we can make a difference. Our diverse  partners have achieved major milestones for bird conservation, including creation of “wall-to-wall”  Joint  Ventures with implementation plans all across  the U.S. and southern Canada, Wildlife Action Plans in all 50
U.S. states, Bird Conservation Region  strategies for all of Canada, and the Neotropical Migratory  Bird Conservation Act – a valuable tool for funding landbird conservation. Since its inception in 1990, PIF has remained focused on its mission to keep common birds common and help species at risk through voluntary partnerships. But to expand our successes and achieve this end,  these partnerships need renewed investment for implementation.

Our conservation vision and successes draw upon  the passion of millions






U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director, Dan Ashe  and Canadian Wildlife Service  Assistant Deputy Minister, Sue Milburn-Hopwood are committed to strong partnerships that support landbird conservation.
of people who enjoy watching and studying wild birds, and who contribute a wealth  of data about North American  landbirds. The first part of this 2016 Plan Revision relies heavily on information provided by these citizen scientists to present an improved vulnerability assessment for nearly 450 species, which enables us to assign  extinction risk and stewardship responsibility at different geographic scales.  These  new indicators provide a path  towards stronger and more  strategic conservation planning and action  locally. The outstanding  work
of Joint  Ventures and other partners, as presented in the second part of this document, is a testament to how conservation science and planning guides success on the ground. These  partnerships are thus an essential bridge in the gap  between conservation planning and implementation.

Our message is one  of urgency. The 2016 Plan Revision provides serious  recommendations for conservation delivery that can and must be addressed now to prevent the loss of our most  vulnerable landbirds and prevent continued declines in many of our most  common species. Many of these recommendations target actions across the full life-cycle of birds—ranging from nesting habitats in high latitudes to migration routes throughout the hemisphere to tropical  overwintering habitats south  of our borders. We have inherited a remarkable avifauna
that flows throughout our hemisphere linking nations and continents; it’s imperative that it not be diminished any further.  The 2016 Plan Revision provides the information that we and our partners need to strategically integrate the range-wide habitat requirements of landbird populations with other demands being placed upon  the landscape. Only by investing  in strong, diverse  partnerships—to address the full life-cycle needs of birds—can
we effectively bridge the landbird conservation community’s implementation gap.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 2016 PLAN REVISION


This 2016 Plan Revision documents widespread declines in populations of many of the 448 species of landbirds in the U.S.
and Canada—a foreboding indicator that the health of ecosystems upon  which we all depend is being degraded. Although we have made much progress over the past  20 years, the daunting task of conserving several  hundred landbird species across  vast and varied landscapes under diverse  ownership requires unprecedented levels of cooperation among the public, private,  and industrial  sectors.

In 2004, Partners in Flight (PIF) published the first North  American Landbird  Conservation Plan (NALCP, Rich et al.), presenting the results of a comprehensive landbird species vulnerability assessment for the U.S. and Canada. The 2004 NALCP presented a Watch List that identified the species of highest conservation concern, along with a summary  of their status, monitoring needs, and the first estimates of population size, leading to bold  continental population objectives. Compelling new science that refines  the  biological
foundation of our conservation indicators and  objectives, combined with new opportunities for conservation throughout the  full life- cycle of these species, prompted us to revise  and  update the  Plan.

We intend this 2016 Plan Revision to:
1.   Refine  and update the relative vulnerability  assessment of 448 species of North  American  landbirds;
2.   Present  new scientific assessments and tools to integrate into range-wide and full life-cycle conservation implementation; and
3.   Deliver recommendations to advance high priority landbird conservation actions over the next 10 years.

We encourage:
•   Conservation practitioners to implement and evaluate conservation actions to achieve the continental landbird population objectives presented in this Plan Revision;
•   Leaders and decision makers  to guide policy and allocate
resources to benefit landbird conservation broadly;  and
•   All PIF partners to share  this Plan Revision widely with colleagues, young  professionals and students to foster  a greater appreciation for and engagement in bird conservation.
“Birds are

indicators of the environment. If they are in trouble, we
know we’ll soon be in trouble.”

WHAT IS PARTNERS IN FLIGHT?
PIF is a dynamic  and welcoming network  of more  than  150 partner organizations throughout the Western Hemisphere engaged in all aspects of landbird conservation, from science, research, planning, and policy development, to land management, monitoring, education, and outreach. All are dedicated to PIF’s simple,  proactive mission:
Keeping common birds  common and helping species at risk through voluntary partnerships.


Our strategic goals  remain unchanged since  1990:
•   Maintain healthy  bird populations, in natural  numbers, in healthy  habitats and ecosystems;
•   Keep species from becoming threatened or endangered through proactive measures and science-based planning;
•    Promote full life-cycle conservation of migratory birds throughout the Western Hemisphere; and
•    Promote the value of birds as indicators of environmental health and human  quality of life.

INTRODUCTION TO THE 2016 PLAN REVISION


WHAT IS NEW SINCE 2004?
This 2016 Plan Revision presents four new and updated tools for bird conservation:
•   Extinction Risk models that convey quantitative measures of urgency;
•   Responsibility assignments for continental Watch List species scaled to Joint  Ventures and Bird Conservation Regions  (BCR);
•   Full life-cycle analysis of year-round  eBird data to identify areas  of greatest importance to migrants in the non-breeding season; and
•    Species assessment scores updated with improved access to the associated  PIF database.








eBird is an online  database of bird observations providing scientists, researchers, and amateur naturalists with real-time  data about bird distribution and abundance. Data from eBird can be used to create  detailed maps  of year-round distribution and abundance as the example above for Magnolia  Warbler illustrates.

Many people are conserving, studying, and watching migratory  birds. Our success relies on building a passionate and engaged community.
Today we have unprecedented opportunities for collaborative conservation at multiple  scales  and across  jurisdictional boundaries. Over the last two decades the PIF network  has made important progress in helping to create a new “bird conservation landscape” that includes:

•   Joint  Ventures dedicated to all-bird conservation in every major region and habitat in the U.S. and parts  of Canada.

•   State  Wildlife Action Plans in every U.S. state with strategies for conserving species of greatest conservation need.

•   BCR Plans completed for all of Canada.

•   State  of the Birds Reports produced in both countries under the North  American  Bird Conservation Initiative.

•   National surveys that assess the activities, values, and motivations of hunters, viewers, and other members of the public, results  of which can improve  our understanding of these audiences to better engage them  in conservation.

•   Millions of dollars available  through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Bill Conservation Programs that provide technical assistance and financial incentives to landowners to manage habitats for birds and other wildlife.

•   State  Wildlife Grant money  available  in every state to carry out State  Wildlife Action Plans.

•    Neotropical Migratory  Bird Conservation Act, North American  Wetlands Conservation Act, National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grants,  Urban Bird Treaty, and other grant  programs.

•   Recognition of 52 million bird watchers as the fastest growing segment of outdoor recreation users.

•   Tri-national Vision document for landbird conservation that includes Mexico and Central  American  species assessments as a first step to identifying  hemispheric priorities.

We must find new ways to address habitat loss and degradation as the primary causes of bird declines.

A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY
Although we have made significant  progress since
2004, many landbird species continue to exhibit alarming population declines. The steepest recent declines are seen in grassland birds, species of aridland habitats such as sagebrush and  desert scrub, and  forest species dependent on specialized structural features or natural disturbance. PIF estimates that breeding landbird populations have been reduced by over a billion individuals  since
1970. Several PIF priority species have recently  been petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and in Canada formerly common and widespread species are increasingly being listed under the Species at Risk Act.

Our new urgency analyses indicate that the window for reversing declines and preventing endangerment is narrower than  we thought. Among  the 86 Watch List species presented in this 2016 Plan Revision, 22 species that have already  lost at least half of their population in the past  40 years are projected to lose an additional 50% of their current  population within
the next 40 years. For at least six species this “half-life” window is fewer than  20 years. Equally troubling is that nearly  half of all Watch  List species are too  poorly monitored to predict future trajectories, adding to
the  sense of urgency for these species.

The daunting challenge of conserving landbird populations can only be addressed through strong and  sustainable partnerships among the public, private  and industrial  sectors. Within each  of the
following sections, we offer a set of PIF Recommended
Actions that will be necessary in the coming decade
to prevent future species listings, keep common birds from becoming highly threatened, address the full
life-cycle needs of migratory birds, and bridge the gap between science-based planning and successful on- the-ground implementation. We encourage readers to review these important actions and help develop new and creative ways to carry them  out.

Urgency:
Symbol to Look For







Wherever the hourglass icon appears in this document, it indicates a species with a short  “half-life” and high urgency (less than  30 years to an additional 50% population loss). The Pinyon Jay below  is an example of a
species with urgent conservation needs
—it has a half-life of only 19 years, and faces threats from changing forest conditions. It is strongly  tied to piñon pine  forests  as a major seed disperser in that ecosystem.

SPECIES OF CONTINENTAL CONCERN


With nearly 450 breeding landbirds in the U.S. and Canada, and limited  resources for conservation of terrestrial habitats, identifying  the species most  in need of conservation action  is the key to efficient and effective  bird conservation at multiple  scales.  Our primary tool for identifying  the highest-concern species is the Partners in Flight (PIF)  Species Assessment Process.

The PIF Watch  List identifies 86 species—these are the  species of highest conservation concern at the continental (range-wide) scale  (Table 1). Some  of these species are already  recognized as federally  threatened or endangered in the U.S. and Canada. The Watch List fosters  proactive conservation that will help recover populations of the most  at-risk species and keep the remaining species from becoming endangered. Refer to Watch List Table at a Glance  on page 5 for definitions of table headings.



The primary purpose of the PIF Watch List is to foster proactive attention to the conservation needs of the continent’s most vulnerable landbird species.





































Proactive and voluntary  conservation measures by industry,  agency, and non-governmental organization partners helped to preclude the need for federal  listing of the Cerulean  Warbler in the United  States. The Cerulean  Warbler Technical  Group  has served as a model for other,  similar working  group partnerships focused on conservation of high-priority  and declining species.

VULNERABILITY FACTORS
PIF scores the relative vulnerability of all landbirds according to the following six factors.  Scores  for each  factor range from 5 to 1 (high to low). See pages 96-101 for more  details on PIF Science Based  Approach. Appendix A contains assessment scores for all landbirds. The color-coded columns following the species names in Table 1 indicate each  species’ scores for the six factors:

5            4            3            2            1

POPULATION  SIZE (PS)
Total number of adult  individuals  in the global  population. Small populations have higher  vulnerability.
THREATS BREEDING (TB)
Effects of current  and probable future conditions that threaten a species’ ability to survive and reproduce in its breeding areas.

BREEDING DISTRIBUTION (BD) Geographic extent of a species’ breeding range.  Restricted breeding ranges have higher  vulnerability.
THREATS NON-BREEDING (TN) Effects of current  and probable future conditions that threaten a species’ ability to survive during  the non- breeding season.

NON-BREEDING DISTRIBUTION (ND)
Geographic extent of a species’ non-breeding range.  Restricted non-breeding ranges have higher vulnerability.
POPULATION  TREND (PT)
Direction  and magnitude of long-term changes in population size.  Species with long-term population loss of at least
50% are considered most  vulnerable.

LOSS
Percentage of global  population lost over the past  44 years (1970-2014).

URGENCY/HALF-LIFE
Estimated number of years until an additional 50% of the global  population is lost (i.e., a species’ “half-life”) if current  population trends (past 10 years) continue into the future. Blank entries indicate insufficient data to calculate an estimate. An * next to a number indicates a confidence interval of >40 years around the estimate.

CONTINENTAL THREATS
Major threats affecting each  species presented in order of severity. See the Continental Threats  section for more details and Figure 3, page 14 for a key to abbreviations.

SPECIES OF CONTINENTAL CONCERN



RED WATCH LIST SPECIES: PIF’s population goal  for these 19 species of highest concern is to RECOVER populations well above current levels. These  species have relatively high scores

PS    BD

ND   TB   TN    PT
for all vulnerability factors (illustrated by the  red  bars in the  adjacent figure,  presented in the  same order as the  columns in Table 1). They have restricted distributions and small, declining populations. Most face elevated threats and also are habitat specialists, requiring focused management for particular
habitat conditions. Several are threatened by rapidly changing climate–Saltmarsh Sparrow  from sea-level rise, Black and Brown-capped Rosy-finches from loss of alpine  snowfields.  Increased support is necessary to successfully  recover these species and prevent additional listings. More targeted monitoring is needed to clarify urgency and evaluate actions.
















Red Watch  List species include  two lekking  grouse— iconic and spectacular birds in genuine danger of extinction—including the Lesser Prairie-Chicken.



“R” YELLOW WATCH LIST SPECIES:
These  12 species require constant care and long- term assessment to meet PIF’s goal  to PREVENT DECLINES. This group has

high vulnerability scores for restricted ranges (“R”) and  small populations (red) with moderate threats (orange)  and stable or increasing trends (yellow).
It is critical that the already  high vulnerability of these species due  to ecological specialization is not increased by existing  threats or unpredictable events. If populations of these species begin to decline,
they will become the next Red Watch List species. These  species also need improved monitoring due to high uncertainty in population trend. This group includes numerous species of aridland habitats in the southwestern U.S. as well as several  marsh or grassland specialists.

















The “R” Yellow Watch  List group includes the California Gnatcatcher, which has a small range restricted to extreme southern California and Mexico and needs strong  bi-national  collaboration to protect its full distribution.

The “D” Yellow Watch  List species include  many steeply declining Neotropical migrants  needing
full life-cycle conservation, such as the Connecticut
Warbler.


PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•    Address needs for continental Watch List
species in all regional planning efforts, including Joint  Venture Implementation Plans, State  Wildlife Action Plans, Canadian Bird Conservation Region  Strategies, and full life-cycle conservation plans.
•   Collaborate across jurisdictions so local- scale efforts roll up to meet continental goals  and objectives for highest priority landbirds (see page 26).
•   Work  internationally to conserve migratory Watch List species across  their full life-cycle (see page 20).
•   Fill knowledge gaps  in population status and limiting factors  through targeted monitoring and research, and ensure
that the best science is being applied to conservation.
•   Evaluate conservation efforts by implementing effective  monitoring to assess progress towards population objectives.
•   Build capacity with dedicated resources to keep birds from becoming endangered and requiring expensive federal protection and recovery  efforts.
high population trend scores (red), and moderate to high threats as well as moderate population sizes (orange)  but low vulnerability scores for range (yellow). Many of these species have lost
50%-90% of their population in the past  40 years, declines that are representative of deteriorating conditions in virtually every  terrestrial habitat and region. PIF’s goal for these species is to stabilize populations in the short-term and then  reclaim
a portion of their populations within 30 years, to bring them  to safer levels and avoid special protection measures. Best management practices need to be developed and implemented to maintain the diversity of habitats and successional stages needed by these species.








Watch List species require a wide spectrum of conservation actions—from meeting specific habitat needs
to mitigating threats— across their full ranges and throughout their life-cycles.

1.5 Billion Breeding Birds Lost
While rare and threatened species are usually the focus of conservation attention, Partners in Flight’s (PIF) mission  calls for action to maintain the  abundance
of birds  fundamental for healthy habitats and functioning ecosystems in all regions and  terrestrial habitats. Over one-third of our common landbird species have declined by more  than  15% since
1970, with 46 species losing half or more  of their populations— a net  loss of over  1.5 billion breeding birds  (Figure 1). Many of these relatively abundant and broadly distributed species may not be in imminent danger, but we don’t know where  the tipping point
lies. At what levels will populations be unrecoverable or ecosystem functions impaired? When will these still numerous species spiral down and, like the Passenger Pigeon, disappear? Abundance does not guarantee immunity from significant  and potentially catastrophic declines. This is why PIF works to “Keep  Common

Figure 1. Over  the  past  40 years,  the  total  loss of abundance across 46 steeply declining landbird species has been staggering and could  disrupt the structure and function of the  ecosystems of which they are a part.
































Nearly half of the 1.5 billion breeding landbirds  lost since 1970 have  been Blackpoll Warblers—boreal- forest  breeders that migrate to the Amazonian lowlands  of South  America  and back each  year.
Birds Common.”

COMMON BIRDS IN STEEP DECLINE
As portrayed in State  of the Birds reports in North America and around the world, birds  are excellent indicators of overall environmental health—and their loss signals  danger. Even relatively small percentage reductions in the abundance of widespread common species represent the loss of large  numbers of individuals  and substantial biomass. Such losses  can disrupt ecosystem structure, function,  and services. Thus successful conservation programs must not only address species at risk of extinction but also threats
to the healthy  functioning of the greater ecological community.

As part of our Species Assessment process, PIF identified 24 Common Birds in Steep Decline— species that are still too  numerous or widely distributed to warrant Watch  List status, but  that are experiencing troubling long-term declines (Figure 2). All of these species have lost from 50%-90% of their populations since 1970, and most  are projected to lose another 50% within the next 20-25 years. More than  half are dependent on rural and agricultural
landscapes, where  loss of pastures and weedy  margins, intensified crop production, and increased pesticide use are creating hostile  environments for birds and other wildlife. Almost one-third migrate to Central  or South  America for the non-breeding period, where habitat loss poses a significant  challenge for these species.

10  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
Common Birds in Steep Decline include  several  grassland specialists and birds of desert scrub and other aridland habitats. Reversing  steep declines in grassland and aridland birds—which  also make up 30% of all Watch List species—will  require shifts in farming and grazing  policies  and practices that are compatible with economically viable and sustainable working landscapes. Another group
of birds showing  consistent declines is the aerial insectivores, which include swifts, swallows, nightjars, and large flycatchers.  Dependent on flying insects throughout the year, these species are particularly sensitive  to pesticides as well as to changes in insect  availability due  to climate  change.




















Steep declines among many  aerial insectivores, such as this Common Nighthawk, are a signal of declining environmental health.  Birds help maintain  healthy  ecosystems by providing services  such as insect control,  pollination, and seed dispersal.

KEEPING COMMON BIRDS COMMON


MAINTAINING ABUNDANCE
Central  to maintaining a healthy  avifauna is the concept of stewardship—caring for species where they are most  abundant, even if populations are not yet highly threatened or declining. PIF assigns
stewardship responsibility to geographic areas that have  a high proportion of the  global  population
or range of a species. Because such species are characteristic of the areas  with stewardship responsibility, they merit special  attention to ensure their numbers are retained at levels that enable continued ecological function.  The status  of these species can serve as an indicator of the health of habitats, or even broader geographies, and targeting conservation at these focal species may achieve the habitat goals  that support many landbird species.



PRESERVING THE SPECTACLE OF MIGRATION


The ebb and flow of birds across  our skies mark the passing seasons. The phenomenon of annual  migration, involving billions of birds and many different strategies along  diverse routes, radiates waves of pollination and insect  consumption, connecting countries and cultures throughout the Western Hemisphere. Birds encounter many human  obstacles throughout their journeys,  however, and millions die following collisions with houses, tall buildings, communications towers and other structures, or fall victim to
predators like cats. Migration  stopover habitat, which is critical to fuel long- distance flight, is disappearing and
needs greater protection.
Often  species with a high proportion of their population in a given region have stable or unknown population trends, and many require additional monitoring to improve  our understanding of
their population dynamics. This type of species is particularly important in Canada where  many landbirds have broad distributions and low threats that generally preclude them  from gaining Watch List status. Caring for these species before they reach  the Watch List parallels  the PIF approach of “preventive conservation” to keep Watch List species from official listing as endangered.






The best way to retain abundance is through landscape-level conservation that supports suites of
species representative of every habitat.



12  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
COST-EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION
Targeting and supporting conservation action  for abundant and declining species before they need critical care saves money, and can serve as preventive medicine for other species as well as ecosystem function.  Without action to prevent further losses of abundance, more species will be listed, and  their  recovery will come at a greater cost  to society.

CONSERVATION SUCCESS
Two groups of landbirds have increased over the last 40 years. Of these 60 species, more  than  half are forest  generalists, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and wrens that have adapted well to urban and suburban habitats over the past  200 years, primarily in eastern North  America. The second group is diurnal birds of prey, including Bald Eagle,  Peregrine Falcon,  and Osprey that were brought back from the brink of extinction after banning DDT and indiscriminate shooting, as well as Red-tailed Hawk, and other raptors that are increasingly common in towns and cities. These  conservation success stories  illustrate  that  although birds  are sensitive to environmental change, they  will also respond rapidly  to conservation efforts fueled by political  will and  financial investments.






Eastern Bluebird  populations, once greatly  reduced due  to pesticides and competition with invasive European Starling and House  Sparrow,  have steadily  rebounded through a multitude of local education efforts  and nest-box programs.


PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•    Implement conservation practices in agricultural  and
rangeland landscapes through Farm Bill and other incentive programs to reverse or sustain  grassland and aridland bird populations.

•   Support sustainable forestry practices in the U.S. and
Canada.

•    Reduce the  loss of forests and other habitats in nonbreeding areas  through international programs and policies.

•    Reduce the  use of pesticides, and improve  our knowledge about the role of pesticides in insect  (as prey) and bird population declines.

•    Reduce and prevent collisions  with buildings and other structures by implementing known solutions.

•    Remove feral cats from  public  lands and keep pet  cats from roaming freely.

•    Preserve greenspace and use native  plants  in urban  and suburban landscaping.

•   Use bird-friendly coffee and other sustainable products
from Neotropical countries.

•    Support, promote, and contribute to citizen  science databases such as eBird, Breeding Bird Surveys and Christmas Bird Counts.

































The Bald Eagle is proof  that we can recover  a species when  we identify  and eliminate key threats  with sufficient resources, political support, and
science-based conservation action.

CONTINENTAL THREATS


CONTINENTAL-SCALE THREAT ANALYSIS Several major large-scale forces threaten birds in every region and habitat in North  America. In this section, we take a close look at how these factors  result in elevated threat scores in the Partners in Flight (PIF) vulnerability assessment for landbirds of continental importance
with breeding populations in the U.S. and Canada. By summing the threat scores assigned for Watch
List and Common Birds in Steep Decline  species, we developed a Continental Threat  Index for landbirds (Figure 3). This index summarizes both the number
of these species affected by a specific factor and the severity of those threats at the continental scale for each  species (see page 99).

Our analysis indicates that the two most pervasive threats to landbirds in the  U.S. and  Canada are habitat loss due  to urbanization and  habitat degradation due  to changing forest conditions. Both of these threats affect almost  half (44-45 species) of
the 98 Watch List and Common Birds in Steep Decline

Urbanization (U) Changing Forest Conditions  (F) Tropical Deforestation (T) Climate Change  (Cl) Agricultural Conversion (A)
Changing Rangeland  Conditions  (R) Energy/Resource Extraction (E) Contaminants  (Co)
Disease (D) Invasive Species (I)
Hunting/Trapping (H)
species evaluated for this report. Habitat loss due  to conversion to agriculture and tropical  deforestation, along  with climate  change, also rank very high in terms of overall impact  (30-31 species), followed  by habitat degradation due  to rangeland management (20 species). Other major threat factors  may have severe effects  but on fewer species. Some  factors  like energy extraction and development are likely to increase in scope or severity over the next 10 years.

These  major  threat factors are operating at national, continental, or global  scales, and  cannot be adequately addressed at local or regional levels. Moreover, successful efforts to protect and restore habitats on a given landscape may not result in a net gain if issues, such as urbanization and agricultural conversion, are not remedied through coordinated policy at broader scales.  Joining forces with people
outside the bird conservation community to influence national and international policies  and practices is essential to reduce and remove these threats to birds.

Habitat loss do to urbanization is one  of the two most severe threats  to sustaining healthy  landbird  populations in the U.S. and Canada.
14  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
HABITAT LOSS DUE TO URBANIZATION
Residential and commercial development associated with urban
and suburban sprawl is the largest threat to most  native ecosystems in the U.S. and southern Canada. Although some birds can adapt, unchecked sprawl threatens the populations of more  than  half of
all Watch List species. Bi-national policies  to plan for economic and urban  growth  are urgently  needed.


SOLUTIONS!

•   Adopt smart  growth planning initiatives and legislation to control  sprawl.
•    Create and retain urban green space and bird-friendly practices in developed areas.
•    Support the  forest products industry to retain large, intact blocks of working forests, particularly in the face of increasing economic pressure in the U.S. to subdivide for urban  development.
•   Work  with regional  land trusts to acquire properties that meet both open space and bird conservation objectives.



HABITAT DEGRADATION DUE TO CHANGING FOREST CONDITIONS
More than  850 million acres  of U.S. public lands (see page 71), and
millions of hectares of yet-to-be-developed boreal forests  in Canada, offer an unprecedented opportunity to maintain and enhance bird populations. Large-scale, coordinated planning across  jurisdictional boundaries is key to meeting PIF objectives for widespread and migratory species. Although the total amount of forest  may remain stable in many regions, the structure and condition of these forests are degraded; thus managing for natural  composition has great potential to enhance bird populations on existing  forest  acres.












Urban parks like the High Line in New York City use existing urban environments in unique ways to provide habitat  and connect people to nature.


SOLUTIONS!

•   Incorporate needs of high-priority birds into forest- management guidelines and practices on public and private lands.
•   Implement landscape-level planning for industrial  forestry in the boreal region to retain  natural  biodiversity  and healthy bird populations.
•   Revise  fire-prevention policies  to support natural  forest conditions, and prevent catastrophic fires, degradation of habitat, and loss of native bird populations.
•    Promote management for a shifting mosaic  of forest age structures, including adequate amounts of disturbed early successional and old-growth forest  habitats.
•   Support sustainable forestry practices on private  lands
•    Implement aggressive invasive  species management policies  on public lands and encourage similar action through education on private  lands.


















The Boreal Songbird Initiative is working to apply the highest sustainability standards to forestry operations across the boreal  forest,  which supports three billion breeding birds (see page 81).

CONTINENTAL THREATS


HABITAT LOSS DUE TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION
At least 30% of Watch List species and Common Birds in Steep Decline  depend on highly threatened tropical  forests  in winter— including wet tropical  rainforests, dry forests,  and montane pine-oak and cloud  forests.  Underlying  causes of tropical  deforestation are complex, but primarily trace  to economic issues, poverty, and lack
of enforcement of existing  laws and policies.  Working internationally to stem  the loss of tropical  forests  is as important as protecting and managing breeding habitats in the U.S. and Canada.














Shade-grown coffee and other agroforestry can provide bird-friendly and sustainable products while buffering the loss of tropical forests  in the surrounding landscape.
SOLUTIONS!

•    Support national,  regional, and local initiatives in Latin America and the Caribbean to stop  rates  of tropical deforestation.
•    Develop and implement comprehensive wintering ground conservation plans for migratory species and tropical residents through international partnerships.
•    Generate economic programs to provide alternative, sustainable livelihoods for people in working landscapes.
•   Provide  funding for existing and new  protected areas that support Watch List and resident species.
•    Promote and expand markets for bird-friendly and sustainable products, such as coffee  and cacao, from Neotropical regions.

HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Our assessment indicates that nearly 30% of Watch List species and
Common Birds in Steep Decline  are now threatened by habitat loss and degradation due  to climate  change. In addition, the negative impacts of other factors,  such as energy extraction and development, often  are exacerbated by climate  change effects.  Because this issue has become so important to bird conservation since 2004, we treat  it in a separate section of this plan (see page 18).

HABITAT LOSS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL CONVERSION
Loss of native habitat to agriculture across  North  America remains the greatest threat to steeply declining grassland birds and affects 23%
of Watch List species. Halting this habitat loss is the most  intense and urgent need for the subset of habitat specialists that breed in Canadian and U.S. prairies and winter in the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands of northern Mexico.

Use of best management practices, such as reduced or rotating  grazing intensities and protection of riparian buffers, can make  ranching and bird conservation mutually  beneficial. One-quarter of Watch  List Species
are currently threatened by degraded habitats  on North  American rangelands.

SOLUTIONS!

•   Support conservation provisions of the  Farm Bill
conservation programs in the U.S.
•   Support Mexican partners to improve habitat management and carry out  sustainable practices to
reduce and eventually  reverse the loss of grassland habitat, primarily in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts.
16  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
HABITAT DEGRADATION DUE TO CHANGING RANGELAND CONDITION Ranching  and grazing  can be compatible with
sustainable wildlife populations and healthy  rangeland ecosystems. However,  existing  grazing  intensities
and practices, especially in sagebrush and arid grassland systems, cannot be sustained through this century.  Sustainable ranching presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance and restore habitats and bird populations.

SOLUTIONS!

•   Provide  technical support to encourage sustainable grazing practices that promote healthy  native vegetation, while supporting the livelihoods of ranchers and communities.
•    Identify and protect high-quality public rangelands and restore habitat using native plants  and natural  processes such as fire.


DIRECT THREATS TO BIRD ABUNDANCE
In many cases, the exact  causes of species’ declines are not known. While we know that habitat loss and degradation are the major factors  affecting birds and other wildlife, recent studies have illuminated the magnitude of direct  bird mortality inflicted by anthropogenic sources. For example, free-ranging cats are estimated to kill 2-3 billion birds annually
in the U.S. and Canada, and millions more  die from collisions with automobiles, buildings, power  lines, communication towers  and other structures.

SOLUTIONS!

•    Develop and recommend guidelines to remove feral cats from public lands.
•    Implement proven guidelines to replace steady-burning lighting  on towers.
•   Implement bird-friendly architectural designs and retrofits  for building windows and lighting.
•   Locate  energy infrastructure such as wind turbines to minimize impacts on migrating and resident birds.


2.6  BILLION birds lost               624  MILLION birds lost
214  MILLION birds lost
51 MILLION birds lost








Recent evidence shows  the top  four sources of anthropogenic mortality  of birds in the U.S. and Canada  are from cats, building collisions, auto strikes, and power lines. These mortalities can be significantly  reduced with known  solutions.



SOLUTIONS!
















Many birds can be protected by designing and retrofitting buildings with bird-safe glass, and implementing
Federal Aviation  Administration tower  lighting  standards that would  reduce mortality  by 50-70%.

CLIMATE IMPACTS ON LANDBIRDS


One  of the defining  environmental challenges of the 21st century  is climate  change. Increased temperatures, more extreme weather events, changing moisture levels,  and  rising sea  levels are affecting ecological processes, which in turn  influence the  distribution, abundance, and  survival of many organisms, including birds and  humans. These  changes can adversely impact  bird survival throughout the annual  life-cycle. Birds in every terrestrial and aquatic habitat will be affected, although individual species in each  habitat are likely to respond differently.

The degree to which birds can adapt to further environmental change depends on a suite of  biological traits among species as well as the sensitivity of the habitats on which they depend. Some  birds respond rapidly to changing environments by shifting their distributions; such distributional shifts are already  well documented  for both migratory and resident species. Some  species may not be able  to make such shifts.

Based  on the vulnerability assessment in the  2010 State  of the Birds Report  on Climate  Change, several  groups of species emerge as especially vulnerable to changing climate  in the next decade. In some cases, this new assessment increases the urgency for protecting habitats for Watch List species already  vulnerable due  to other factors.  In other cases, it  highlights additional species not previously  considered vulnerable through Watch List designation.


“How global warming will affect the distribution of birds in the coming millennium is a question of vital importance to those interested in biodiversity.”


Dr. Blair Wolf, University of New Mexico






















Saltmarsh  Sparrows,  which build their nests  just above the high-water line, are among the coastal species gravely threatened by rising sea levels  that inundate low-lying  habitats  such as saltmarshes, barrier islands, and mudflats. Rising ocean temperatures are spawning more  frequent and severe storms, which increase flooding and erosion  of these fragile habitats.
Increased temperatures have  reduced winter and year-round snowpack in mountaintop habitats  and allowed the spread of trees  and shrubs into alpine tundra.  The entire  world population of Brown-capped (pictured  here) and Black Rosy-Finches will lose their tundra  habitat  as montane forests  expand to higher elevations.


18  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
All of our predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on bird populations are based on complex climate  models, as well as equally complex models of the life histories of birds. At the same  time, documented shifts in bird distributions represent some of the strongest evidence that climate  change effects  are already  occurring.

Information to improve our ability to understand and predict the  impacts of climate  change on birds is urgently needed, including:

•   Improved, standardized methods for evaluating which species, suites  of species, or habitats are most  vulnerable to climate  change, including information about sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity;
•   More research on species phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal changes in plants  and animals) and how climate  change may affect interactions between species, habitats and resources;

PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•    Protect native  vegetation to sequester
carbon and reduce greenhouse gases.
•    Protect and restore coastal  salt marshes and facilitate  migration of marshes inland.
•    Create corridors  of high quality  habitat, especially along  elevational and latitudinal gradients, to allow specialized species to shift distribution.
•    Review green energy projects in consideration of sensitive  habitats and migratory flyways to minimize unintended impacts on birds.
•    Protect vital surface  water  sources, especially in riparian and aridland habitats.
•   Focus on reducing habitat loss and degradation as the primary threat to most bird species.
•   Incorporation of demographic parameters (e.g., birth, death, and immigration rates) into bird-habitat-climate models; and
•   Long-term monitoring programs to document changes climate,  responses of species and habitats to climate change, and to ground-truth predictive models.








Climate  change is predicted to worsen  the   climatic extremes in aridlands.  Small-bodied birds such as this Verdin—which already push  the limits of heat
tolerance and dehydration—will be further stressed as precipitation becomes more  variable and heat  waves increase  in intensity, frequency, and duration.

Long-distance migrants  that winter in the Neotropics, such as this American Redstart, experience poor winter habitat  conditions with the drying of seasonally wet tropical forests, as well as potential mismatches
in the timing  of food availability due  to warming temperatures on northern  breeding grounds.

FULL LIFE-CYCLE CONSERVATION


WHAT IS FULL LIFE-CYCLE?
Over the past  decade, Partners in Flight (PIF) has increasingly recognized the importance of understanding and addressing issues faced  by migratory birds throughout their lives and during  their full annual  migratory cycles. Full life-cycle conservation of migratory birds requires actions that provide habitat and reduce mortality throughout the year and across  the globe, wherever the birds might  go.

WINTER GEOGRAPHY MATTERS!
The challenge of conserving migratory birds is complicated by the fact that habitat conditions in one  season can affect the  reproduction and  survival of birds  in subsequent seasons. Poor quality  winter habitat, for example, can affect the timing of migration, leading to decreased survival or reproductive success. Therefore, actions to improve  conditions in the Neotropics can have far-reaching positive  effects  on breeding birds in the U.S. and Canada. Restoring and  managing habitats on the  breeding grounds may not  succeed in reversing declines of many Watch  List species without a similar investment in critical winter  habitats south of the  U.S.

Of the 286 migratory landbirds breeding in the U.S. and Canada, roughly 56% winter primarily south  of the U.S. in one  or more  Neotropical regions. Striking  new results illustrate that where a species spends the  winter  may be a better predictor of population declines than  where it breeds. Species wintering  in Chihuahuan Grasslands of northern Mexico, Central  and South  American  Highlands, and South  American  Lowlands are experiencing steeper declines than  species wintering  in other regions (see Figure 7).

MISSING LINKS
For the billions of landbirds that pour  south  into Latin America and the Caribbean each  year, identifying  what is causing a species to decline has been extremely challenging. In most  cases, we know little about migratory routes or stopover sites south  of the U.S., and for some species of conservation concern, we still do not know where  the majority of the population spends the winter.

Because mortality during  migration may be 15 times higher  than  during  the relatively stable breeding and  winter periods, identifying and  protecting key stopover habitats, including those south of the  U.S., is a high priority. These  include  important corridors, bottlenecks, and roost  sites for diurnally migrating raptors, swallows, and swifts, as well as key forested regions where  millions of birds make extended stops to rest and refuel. The Neotropical Flyways Initiative is currently assessing the value of stopover regions and habitats to long-distance migratory birds in Central  and northern South  America.

























Species that winter primarily in the Chihuahuan grasslands of northern  Mexico, such as Baird’s Sparrow,  are experiencing the steepest declines of any North  American landbirds.

NEW METRICS FOR FULL LIFE-CYCLE CONSERVATION
PIF used eBird data to identify important areas  for Watch List species during  the nonbreeding periods (see Table 1 on pages 6-7). For example, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and the Caribbean lowlands  of Mexico (Bird Conservation Regions  [BCR] 49, 52, 55-57, 64-66) are most  important in winter for Wood  Thrush. The Gulf Coastal Prairie (BCR 37) and Mississippi Alluvial Valley (BCR 26) have markedly  higher  bird usage during  migration seasons, suggesting their value as important stopover areas  (see below  figures). Models  of predicted abundance using eBird data (Figure 4) indicate that Wood  Thrush spends 40% of the year on their wintering  grounds (Figure
5). The total area  supporting the majority of the population is much smaller in winter (Figure 6). Thus, Wood Thrush are twenty-four times more  concentrated on their wintering  grounds than  on the breeding grounds. These  new metrics  provide valuable information for full life-cycle conservation planning.

FULL LIFE-CYCLE CONSERVATION



CONNECT  THE DOTS Many bird species breed over broad geographic areas  and have sub- populations that migrate along  different routes and winter in different regions. Although broad geographic patterns
of migratory connections are well known for some groups of birds (see PIF’s Saving Our Shared Birds report), understanding how specific populations are connected geographically throughout their life-cycle is critical to stabilizing  and reversing declines for high-priority species. New technology
is greatly  increasing our ability to track individuals  and link the breeding, wintering,  and stopover areas  required
by populations throughout the year.
FILLING KNOWLEDGE GAPS
This is an exciting  time to be studying the life-cycles
of migratory birds. Continuing technological advances in satellite telemetry, light-level and GPS geolocators, and other marking methods enable the accurate tracking  of individual birds over vast distances. Tracking data, combined with stable isotopes and new molecular markers, are enabling us to connect the breeding, wintering, and  stopover regions for specific  populations.

At the same  time, birder-generated observational data are rapidly accumulating and freely available  at eBird, allowing for accurate mapping and modeling of dynamic species distributions throughout the year such as for the Wood  Thrush illustrated on page 21. These and other monitoring data as well as demographic information from bird observatories throughout the hemisphere are available  from the  Avian Knowledge  Network.

Despite this proliferation of technology and data, we are just scratching the surface  of the knowledge needed to understand factors  that limit population growth  and develop life-cycle models for most Watch List species. A greatly expanded network of
demographic monitoring sites  is needed to fill these many knowledge gaps.


























The  Migratory Connectivity Project is using the latest technological advances to coordinate research  on a wide  variety of species such as the Gray Catbird.
PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•   Increase resources available  through
Neotropical Migratory  Bird Conservation Act, Southern Wings, North  American  Wetlands Conservation Act and other sources to implement priority landbird projects.
•   Build capacity within Latin American and Caribbean nations for sustainable, landscape-scale conservation.
•    Develop and implement a hemispheric bird-monitoring strategy that includes demographics to inform management and track conservation success.
•    Expand the  use of new  technologies
(e.g. geolocators, nanotags) to determine migratory connectivity, key stopover sites, and accurate winter distribution maps  for poorly studied species.
•   Use integrated, full life-cycle  population models to assess limiting factors  and causes of species declines.

PIF FRAMEWORK FOR FULL LIFE-CYCLE CONSERVATION
In 2013, PIF’s Fifth International Conference (PIF V) brought together more  than  240 conservation professionals from 120 organizations and 16 countries across  the Americas to launch a new framework  for full life-cycle bird conservation. Focused initially on seven  winter geographies (Figure 7) shared by suites  of Watch List species, participants at PIF V began a process of developing comprehensive Conservation Business  Plans that identify key threats and actions necessary to conserve migratory birds throughout the Western Hemisphere.

POPULATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES



BACKGROUND ON PIF POPULATION OBJECTIVES
The 2004 PIF Plan broke  new ground by establishing range- wide population objectives for landbirds of high conservation concern. These  objectives
were quantitative (% change relative to current  status), measurable (through the BBS), and easily communicated—
all characteristics of useful population objectives. Objectives were based on long- term population trends with
the aim of returning declining species to levels around 1970, near  the start of the BBS.


Some  partners considered

PIF’s 2004 objectives unrealistic while others found  them  a useful starting point  to develop regional objectives. This 2016
Plan Revision provides both short- and long-term objectives that are tied to a goal  for each group of Watch List species, and are based on more  pragmatic outcomes than  returning populations to levels of the
1970s, while still based on long-

term trends.
WHY SET POPULATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES?
To address the continuing decline in many landbird populations, we must  strategically target our limited  resources on prioritized conservation actions. This is only possible when  partners work together efficiently  toward common goals  and  objectives by coordinating efforts across geographies and  jurisdictions. We can then  evaluate the success of our collective  actions relative to these agreed-upon goals  and objectives.

Conservation goals  are subjective expressions of the values that underlie a group’s actions. Partners in Flight’s (PIF) goals  for conserving bird populations appropriately reflect its mission.  Thus, “helping species at risk” translates into the  goals  of “recover”
and  “prevent declines” (see Table 2 for definitions of these goals) because we value healthy  bird populations and habitats and want to prevent vulnerable species from becoming extinct  or
endangered. “Keeping common birds  common” translates into the goals  of “reverse declines” and  “stabilize” because we value the spectacle, abundance, and diversity of widespread birds that benefit ecosystems and enhance our quality of life.

To meet species’ range-wide population goals,  PIF identifies measurable, range-wide population objectives in Table 2 to inform regional partners’ conservation planning and action.  At the same time, the work of these partners must contribute to meet the range- wide objectives, which can be informed and revised  through partner dialogue across  spatial  scales.



SETTING POPULATION OBJECTIVES: THE CHALLENGE The bird conservation community has wrestled with the concepts and pragmatism of setting population objectives for species of concern for several  decades. Population objectives are considered a fundamental component of adaptive, strategic conservation because they  establish a target for planning, implementation, and
evaluation. The  PIF Technical  Series and  PIF International Conference Proceedings provide recommended approaches and guidelines for establishing population objectives.

How many individuals  are needed to prevent the extinction of a species, and how many birds are needed to restore a population to some historic or desired future degree of commonness? These  are questions that even the best science can only partly answer  because objectives are fundamentally value-based. At the range-wide scale, most  of PIF’s population objectives are based on trends derived
from the North  American  Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Even with this wealth  of data, setting population objectives requires identifying appropriate temporal benchmarks and  evaluating our capability
to restore bird populations given the  dynamics of landscape
conditions and  threats.

24  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
PIF’S REVISED APPROACH TO POPULATION OBJECTIVES
PIF’s population goals  are general statements of
desired future condition. These  goals  are linked to numeric,  measurable population objectives with specific time frames.  In Table 2, we propose short- term (10-year) and long-term (30-year) continental population objectives (see Figure 8 for graphical depictions of these objectives over  time).

These  revised, range-wide goals  and objectives are tied to the different groups of Watch List species and Common Birds in Steep Decline  (see Appendix B for specific objectives for each  species). The objectives reflect a short-term desire to slow and  then halt declines, at a minimum,  for all these bird groups. Objectives differ in the rate at which declines should  be halted, and are based on species’ overall vulnerability, abundance, and threat level. The long-term objectives provide targets for longer range conservation planning, and  reflect the  desire to return declining Watch  List species to at least  a portion of their  former abundance.







Figure 8. Potential scenarios of percent population change over  30 years that  would  achieve population objectives for the  different population goal categories. Reverse Declines and Stabilize scenarios represent species with a long-term trend of -2.5% per year. The red line indicates the  population trajectory
if a trend of -2.5% per year continues unimpeded.

PIF will conduct 10-year progress assessments of the effectiveness of conservation actions toward meeting these objectives. Given population trends and the results  of these assessments and partner dialogue, species objectives may be adjusted in the future as part of an adaptive conservation framework.

To meet species range-wide population goals  and objectives, partners need to translate them  to the regional and local scales  where  they are carrying out conservation actions. Regional  population objectives are often expressed as population size targets that can be translated into habitat objectives. Developing population targets and  habitat objectives is neither simple  nor straightforward. PIF commits to sustained collaborations on this process with Joint  Venture, Bird Conservation Regions (BCR), state, and  provincial  partners.


PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•   Collaborate with partners to develop
regional-scale population goals  and objectives.
•    Implement PIF’s “Five Elements Process of  Conservation Design”  to assess current  and future habitat capacity  and produce realistic regional population and habitat objectives.
•    Develop a complete range-wide set  of regional  objectives and conservation actions through the Tri-Initiative Science Team, and use them  to evaluate conservation progress across  regions.

Range-wide declines in widespread species, such as this Olive-sided Flycatcher, highlight the need
for partners  to collaborate across jurisdictions  to set regional  objectives.

BRIDGING THE IMPLEMENTATION GAP


BRIDGING THE DIVIDE
Science and planning for bird conservation have advanced rapidly over the last decade—setting the stage for action.  We know that landbirds are in urgent need of conservation action  applied consistently across broad landscapes to stabilize  or reverse their population declines. We also know that management of at-risk and endangered species is expensive, so
it makes  sense to conserve birds and their habitats now, before a crisis hits. However,  the  divide  between knowing what  to do and  our ability to do it can
be large  – we call this the  implementation gap. Finding  new mechanisms and resources to bridge
this implementation gap  is essential if we are to move beyond planning and achieve meaningful conservation success. The implementation gap  stems  from three main issues:
1. Scope and scale of the challenge;
2. Lack of conservation capacity; and
3. Need for greater societal awareness and engagement.












Rachel Carson’s seminal  work on the impacts of DDT on bird populations, showed that birds are good indicators  of the environment. Thus, the Peregrine Falcon is a reminder that large-scale  environmental challenges can be addressed with decisive conservation action.


Achieving healthy landbird populations requires
a commitment of new resources to bridge the
gap between planning and implementation
SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE
The 448 landbirds covered by this 2016 Plan Revision occur in every type of habitat. Moreover, during
their life-cycles, most  journey  across  political and international boundaries and encounter a diversity of human  communities and environmental challenges along  the way. Thus the scope of the effort needed to conserve these species is enormous. In the following sections, Partners in Flight (PIF) presents landbird conservation priorities  at a scale appropriate for U.S. and Canadian regional partnerships to adopt and work toward. By addressing the needs of Watch List species and Common Birds in Steep Decline  at the Joint Venture and Bird Conservation Region  scale, PIF is facilitating  the work of regional partners to refine and strengthen their conservation efforts for landbirds.

CONSERVATION CAPACITY
Like any voluntary partnership, PIF’s ability to bridge the gap  between planning and implementation relies on the strength of our network.  Human and financial resources are the core of our conservation capacity. People discover what’s limiting bird populations
and use that information to plan conservation and design landscapes to meet the needs of birds and society.  People integrate conservation needs and policy recommendations to create habitat programs for birds and other wildlife. Financial resources enable people to generate this information and put this conservation in place. People participating at all levels of government agencies, non-governmental
28  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
organizations, and industry,  as well as individuals  can influence  bird habitats or mitigate direct  mortality of landbirds, and play essential roles in garnering and delivering needed resources internationally, nationally, and locally (see Figure 8, page 30).

SOCIETAL AWARENESS & ENGAGEMENT
Conservation is a societal and cultural challenge.
To bridge the implementation gap  and achieve our conservation objectives, we must engage people who already  watch and appreciate birds, as well as those who are motivated by human  health or other concerns. Making connections between cultural values and conservation can motivate people to take action  and be a powerful  mechanism for success.

People enjoy and care about birds. One  of every six citizens in the United  States and Canada—people from all walks of life—participate in bird watching, whether they watch the backyard bird feeder or travel long distances to see  birds. People are concerned
when more  species are assigned endangered or at-risk status. Thus, many contribute time, money  and data
for conservation. For example, citizen science data have been critical to developing conservation plans and identifying  steep population declines in common species. We must continue to mobilize  this passion for birds and turn it into conservation action  at every level.

TURNING PASSION INTO ACTION
According to recent national surveys, the

52 million citizens in the United  States and Canada who watch birds will spend over $14 billion each  year on travel and equipment to do so. If mobilized, this constituency has the potential to enhance conservation capacity  by increasing resources and influencing decisions to benefit birds and their habitats. We need better mechanisms to facilitate  direct contributions to habitat conservation and other expressions of support for healthy ecosystems where  bird populations thrive.


“Our generation will be judged by the state in which we leave (fish and wildlife)
resources to the next.”

BRIDGING THE IMPLEMENTATION GAP


LEARNING FROM WATERFOWL SUCCESS Wetlands and waterfowl conservation in North America provides a successful model of complex implementation at multiple  scales.  This effort captured a three-way linkage  among legislated policy and funding at a continental scale (North American  Wetlands Conservation Act), coordinated science across  species ranges (North American Waterfowl Management Plan) and the delivery
of habitat conservation by local partnerships (Migratory Bird Joint  Ventures). The success of this model speaks for itself through consistently rising populations of waterfowl, and benefits to some wetland associated landbirds.
For landbird conservation, this three-way linkage exists but is fragile and lacks the resources for implementation required to reverse declining bird populations. Legislated policy and funding is in place for hemispheric application (Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act), coordinated science across species ranges exists (e.g., this 2016 Plan Revision), and local and regional conservation partnerships have
committed to PIF’s objectives for landbird conservation (e.g., Joint  Ventures and other groups). Significantly more  resources and public engagement are needed to fuel this collaborative framework  and restore declining bird populations.
GOVERNMENTS






INDUSTRIES

Industries are key partners in bird conservation, and can influence the actions of communities and neighboring corporations. Many industries also manage large landbases.
Federal, state, provincial, and local governments provide conservation leadership at multiple scales, fund conservation programs, set  policy, and manage millions of acres of land.

Key programs:
• The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act
• The Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (U.S.)
• The Prevention Stream of the  Habitat Stewardship Program
(Canada)
• The State Wildlife Grants Program (U.S.)
• Sustainable Forest Management programs (Canada)

Examples:
• Work with multi-national companies to protect breeding and non-breeding habitats.
• Promote sustainable practices such  as sustainable forestry initiatives and shade-grown coffee.



Increasing Conservation Capacity



INDIVIDUALS

Citizens play a key role in bird conservation by managing millions of acres of private lands, supporting conservation NGOs, advocating for sound conservation policies, and
providing valuable citizen-science data on birds.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

Non-governmental organizations and community groups bring expertise and capacity to citizen  science projects, local and regional conservation efforts, and outreach and education.

Examples:
• Provide strong advocacy for conservation through unified voices.
• Acquire and protect local land  through acquisition and other conservation action.
• React  quickly to emerging conservation needs and opportunities.

Examples:
• Use incentive programs to help people manage their lands for birds  and wildlife.
• Support local land  trusts to conserve valuable bird habitats.
• Promote bird-friendly products.
• Promote citizen  contributions to bird-monitoring databases such  as the  Breeding Bird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, and eBird.

PIF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
•   Fuel the  existing landbird  conservation network with
increased resources to ensure partners are able  to link full life-cycle conservation science and planning with implementation, including increased support for: Neotropical Migratory  Bird Conservation Act, Joint Ventures, Habitat Stewardship Program, State  Wildlife Grants  and the operational budgets of government
agencies charged with bird conservation and management;
•    Develop a proposal for funding implementation of BCR Strategy recommendations in Canada.
•   Enhance and strengthen PIF regional  working groups and other groups to better support regional and local-scale conservation action.
•    Identify and address critical information needs, such as full life-cycle approaches and migratory connectivity, and increase research capacity.
•    Generate and use human  dimensions research information to engage the birdwatching constituency and other audiences in supporting bird and habitat conservation.
•    Engage communities in implementing solutions that mitigate direct  bird mortality.






Private landowners are the primary decision-makers on about 890 million acres in the U.S. Meeting the needs of landowners in the U.S. and Canada  is essential for successful bird conservation.
BLUE RIBBON PANEL ADDRESSES CAPACITY NEEDS
In both the U.S. and Canada, conservation strategies have been developed to stabilize  or reverse declining bird populations. In
the U.S., State  Wildlife Action

Plans for all 50 states document

12,000 species, subspecies or populations with the greatest conservation need. In Canada, 25
Bird Conservation Region  (BCR) Strategies identify 232 landbird species, subspecies or populations (out of 310) that are a priority in
at least one  BCR. However,  no dedicated source of sufficient funds has been approved in either  country to implement these recommended actions.
In the U.S., the  Association of Fish  and Wildlife Agencies Blue Ribbon  Panel on Sustaining America’s Diverse Fish and Wildlife Resources published its finding in March 2016, and documented that at least an additional $1.3 billion is needed for states to proactively halt species declines. The Blue Ribbon Panel recommends using revenue from oil and gas leases on public lands to provide funding to states for wildlife species of greatest conservation need—including 95% of PIF Watch List species.

These  spotlights provide a more  in-depth view of conservation topics  and issues, ranging from Northern Bobwhite conservation to the use of focal species to the
importance of the boreal forest

for breeding landbirds.
REGIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PROFILES
While conservation planning happens at international, national, or ecoregional scales, action is best taken locally by those who know how the  lands,  waters, and  human  and  natural communities will respond. In the following sections, we present a regional profile for each  U.S. and Canadian Joint  Venture or Bird Conservation Region (BCR) (see map  on next page). Note that regions in Canada represent a combination of existing  habitat Joint  Ventures and amalgamated BCRs that share  major habitat types.  Each profile provides five elements: a regional map  that is overlaid  with BCRs and jurisdictional boundaries; a table listing Partners in Flight (PIF) Continental
Species of Importance (see page 34 for Regional  Table at a Glance section);  a description of the area’s bird conservation landscape; a “Conservation in Action” success story; and a “Looking Ahead” list of next steps to make progress in achieving regional objectives. In combination, the elements in each  of these profiles illustrate  the important roles that regional partnerships play in implementing PIF plans and contributing to continental objectives for landbirds. PIF is
committed to bringing the needed capacity  for landbird conservation to those partnerships, working for habitat management and acquisition, conservation policy, conservation science and planning, and to facilitate  full life-cycle conservation.

IMPORTANCE OF MIGRATORY BIRD JOINT VENTURES Joint  Ventures represent diverse  partnerships of government agencies, non-profit organizations, corporations, tribes,  and individuals  working together to design and implement landscape-scale conservation efforts in support of the North
American  Waterfowl Management Plan, PIF, and other conservation plans for shorebirds, waterbirds, and resident game birds. Joint Ventures carry out a wide range of bird conservation actions
that include  planning and prioritization; project development and implementation; monitoring, evaluation, and research; communications, education, and outreach; and grant  development and funding support.

Widely accepted as the model for collaborative conservation in
the 21st century,  Joint  Ventures are a proven mechanism to bridge the gap  between science-based planning and on-the-ground implementation. They work successfully  across  geographic, political, and organizational boundaries to integrate bird conservation
needs shared by multiple  levels of government agency and non- governmental organizational partners. Thus, Joint  Ventures tailor conservation to the specific needs of their regions. In the next part of this 2016 Plan Revision, each  Joint  Venture provides their unique perspective on how they undertake bird conservation.

Thanks  to all the  Joint  Venture staff  for providing their regional
profile  descriptions and stories.

REGIONAL TABLE AT A GLANCE
The tables of Species of Continental Importance in the Joint  Venture and Regional  profiles contain the following information. Note that all information presented in these tables reflects the  regional scale  and  is specific  to each Joint  Venture or Region,  including Urgency/Half-life and population change information (see pages 96-99). All “* * *” entries indicate insufficient or unreliable data to calculate a regional estimate, including all wintering populations.

SPECIES
Red = Red Watch List, Yellow = Yellow Watch List, Tan = Common Birds in Steep Decline Season(s) of occurrence with high relative abundance: (B) = breeding, (W) = winter, (R) = resident Species are grouped by their primary habitat within a Joint  Venture or Region.

BCR
Numbers correspond to BCRs (see map  on page 118).
X indicates a BCR where  the species occurs  at a level of  >1% of the global  population.

AREA IMPORTANCE
Relative importance of the Joint  Venture or Region  to a species based on % of Breeding Population or
Non-breeding Area Importance (indicated by “AI=#”). Red text indicates HIGH area  importance (i.e.,  >25% of population or AI = 5).

URGENCY/HALF-LIFE
Estimated number of years until an additional 50% of the regional population is lost (i.e., a species’ “half- life”within the Joint  Venture or Region) if current  population trends (past 10 years) continue into the future. Red text indicates HIGH urgency (i.e., half-life <30 years). A “*” next to a number indicates a confidence interval of
>40 years around the half-life estimate.

LONG-TERM  CHANGE
Percentage change in regional population over the past  44 years (1970-2014).

SHORT-TERM  TREND
Average annual  % change in regional population over the past  10 years (2004-2014).

Joint Ventures work toward  achieving range-wide habitat  objectives for birds, and reflect  the local and regional
culture and environmental priorities of their geographic regions.

IMPROVING HABITATS AND LIVELIHOODS IN THE SONORAN  JOINT VENTURE Combined with habitat protection and restoration, birding ecotourism can be an important piece of a larger  solution  to the issues facing migratory landbirds. In 2007, the Sonoran Joint  Venture and Pronatura Noroeste trained residents of communities near important conservation sites in northwest Mexico to be bird guides. The goal:  protect Neotropical migratory birds  and  their habitats by combining on-the-ground restoration and  protection efforts with local ecotourism project development. Although birding ecotourism is not a panacea, it can help provide an economic incentive for conservation.

Over the course of the two-year  program, guide trainees in the Colorado River Delta (Sonora and Baja California), Álamos (Sonora), and San José del Cabo (Baja California Sur) developed their guiding skills, but they also participated in monitoring, habitat restoration, and education and outreach efforts in their communities. All of these locations provide critical migratory stopover habitat for landbirds during  migration as well as wintering  habitat for birds that breed in the United  States and Canada. Hundreds of migratory species benefited from these habitat restoration efforts, including Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, Least  Bell’s Vireo, Savannah Sparrow, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Rufus Hummingbird, and Gray Vireo.

One  of the challenges to conservation in Mexico is lack of knowledge about the status  and distribution of bird populations. Over the course of the two year training  program, guide trainees submitted over 200 checklists  to eBird, contributing to the state of knowledge about bird populations in these priority sites as they developed their bird identification skills.

As part of the program, the time guide trainees spent volunteering made a significant  and
direct  impact  to regional bird and habitat conservation priorities.  By the end  of the project, trainees worked  on fifteen unique projects with thirteen different partners and contributed over 1,400 hours of their time. Projects included bird monitoring with training  in banding and point  count techniques; habitat restoration activities; installation of camera traps for large  mammal monitoring; desert tortoise monitoring; forest  fire control  activities; repairing a cabin used for tourism; environmental education and community outreach; and a trash clean-up campaign.

One  final part of the program was the development of the Mexico Birding Trail, a comprehensive website designed to connect birders to guides who completed the program and share  information about conservation efforts at each  site.




Guides participated
in monitoring, habitat restoration, education and outreach for species such as the Yellow-billed Cuckoo.
In the years since the project ended, one  participant became employed as a full-time natural  history and birding guide, while others supplement their jobs with part-time guide work. In addition, some have been hired as full or part-time park rangers or field technicians by conservation organizations, thus continuing to contribute to conservation in the region.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Appalachian Mountains Joint  Venture encompasses some of
the largest expanses of deciduous forest  remaining in the eastern U.S. These  forests  have changed drastically over the last century due to the timber boom of the late 1800s and early 1900s, the increase and subsequent abandonment of farmland  acreage from the mid-1900s  through the 1980s, and extraction of fossil fuels. Loss of historic natural  disturbances, such as fire and grazing  by bison and eastern woodland elk, once  maintained a dynamic  and resilient forest  landscape. This loss, coupled with current  fire suppression,
public opposition to forest  management, and urbanization, now limit organizations from carrying out management actions that would mimic these disturbances. Appalachian forests  also continue to be subject to a variety of stressors such as disease, insect  pests, invasive species, over-browsing by deer, and continued energy development. As a result, these forests  now lack much of the structural diversity
and range of forest  age  classes  needed by several  bird species. For example, Watchlist species such as Golden-winged Warbler and Prairie Warbler need early successional forest,  while Cerulean Warbler and Wood Thrush breed in mature forest.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Revitalizing a Dynamic  Forest  Landscape
A major priority of Joint  Venture partners is to improve  the health and resiliency of Appalachian forests  and landbird populations by reviving a dynamic  forest  landscape that contains a mosaic  of forest  structure and age  classes. Although this requires a long-term process of
actively managing forests  and restoring degraded systems, partners have made substantial progress over the last five years for two of their highest priority species: Golden-winged Warbler and Cerulean Warbler. Using science-based management guidelines developed by partners and broader working groups, the Joint  Venture is
coordinating habitat conservation for both of these species on public and private  land within focal areas  across  the region.










Multiple  species, including Cerulean Warbler,  Golden-winged Warbler and Wood Thrush, can be supported in the same  landscape through integrated conservation and management of different forest  age  classes.
One  of the Joint  Venture’s greatest successes has been engaging private  landowners through two recent Natural  Resources Conservation Service initiatives: Working Lands for Wildlife and the Regional  Conservation Partners Program. Through these programs partners across  five states have committed tens  of thousands of acres of private  lands for Golden-winged Warbler and Cerulean Warbler habitat enhancements and private  land conservation easements. In addition, 1,000 acres  of legacy  surface  mine lands in Kentucky are being reforested with deciduous species such as blight-resistant American  Chestnuts.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Atlantic Coast  Joint  Venture encompasses the entire  U.S. portion
of the Atlantic Flyway and about one-third of the country’s states and human  population. It supports an incredible diversity of terrestrial and wetland habitats, from boreal forests  and bogs in the north
to tropical  forests  and mangroves in the south.  Several species of landbirds are entirely or largely endemic or restricted to the region, including the Watchlist species Saltmarsh Sparrow, Seaside Sparrow, and Bachman’s Sparrow. Serious threats from climate  change and expanding suburban, urban, industrial,  and agricultural land use
along  the East Coast  are further destroying and degrading habitats that are already  greatly  reduced from their historic extent. The Joint Venture is working to protect the best available  habitats and enhance and restore degraded habitats through federal funding programs such as the North  American  Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program, and Farm Bill Conservation programs. The Joint  Venture works with many federal, state, and private  landowners—particularly through land trusts—to conserve vital habitats for Partners in Flight species.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Partnering for Saltmarsh Conservation
Coastal marsh conservation is a high priority in the Joint  Venture as it supports many species of highest concern, including Saltmarsh Sparrow, Black Rail and American  Black Duck. Most saltmarsh habitat in northeastern and mid-Atlantic  states has been lost or degraded by three centuries of draining and filling for development, ditching for agriculture and mosquito control,  and widespread invasions by exotic reeds. Also, sea-level rise due  to climate  change is now a major
threat. While saltmarsh is relatively intact  and extensive in the South Atlantic, continued protection is needed to provide refugia  for many of the saltmarsh-obligate species.










Rising sea-levels are threatening the Saltmarsh  Sparrow,  a tidal marsh specialist.
To protect the Saltmarsh Sparrow and other tidal marsh-dependent species, Joint  Venture partners have conserved more  than  200,000 acres  of coastal marsh in the last two decades, largely through the NAWCA and Coastal Grants  programs. Partners are restoring tidal flow and natural  hydrology, acquiring lands adjacent to saltmarsh, facilitating  the creation of future saltmarsh habitat, and allowing for saltmarsh migration. These  are challenging tasks, as many coastal areas  are highly developed, which makes  most  undeveloped coastal real estate extremely expensive.

Protecting habitat provides for outdoor recreation, tourism- related jobs, clean air and drinking water, and supports multi-billion dollar industries such as timber extraction and
commercial fisheries.


LOOKING AHEAD
•    Protect uplands and wetlands with the greatest potential to become future saltmarsh and facilitate  marsh migration.

•    Continue to protect the vast array of forested wetlands on the landscape that provide important breeding, migratory, and wintering habitat to high priority Partners in Flight species.

•   Increase engagement with the Natural Resources Conservation Service and private landowners to increase effectiveness of Farm Bill conservation practices for highest priority species.

THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL FOREST LANDS Private and public forests  managed for commercial timber production provide important habitat for most forest  bird species. The distributions of these species are largely on private  lands in eastern forests,  while public lands play a larger  role in western forests.  These working forests  typically consist  of a mix of forest  ages, types,  and structures, and provide a shifting mosaic  of forest  conditions required by a number of declining, disturbance-dependent birds. When commercial
forest  lands are adjacent to other ownership types,  all ownerships have the potential to complement each other and deliver habitat diversity to benefit birds across  landscapes.

Forest  landowners often  implement management practices for biodiversity  conservation such as retention of snags, downed wood,  and trees with wildlife
benefits. Additional practices, including vegetation buffers for water quality protection, also benefit birds. Regular forest  management practices, such as clearcutting, thinning, natural  regeneration and re- planting, often  create forest  conditions that mimic

Habitat management strategies that maintain  large parcels can benefit priority species, such as Brown Thrasher, and also provide economic benefits.
natural  disturbance and forest  succession and support many declining species.

Commercial forest  owners  often  manage working forests  under sustainable forestry certification programs that maintain biological diversity, conserve threatened and endangered species, control invasive species, and carry out other aspects of sustainability. These  programs also encourage landowners to incorporate state and regional conservation priorities  into their management plans, which gives people an opportunity to contribute to achieving bird conservation objectives.

Science-based information on bird conservation helps  landowners efficiently allocate resources to specific conservation objectives where  they can make a difference. The forest  products industry, for example, has a long history of contributing to all aspects of the conservation. Contributions have ranged from science and data input for species such as Bald Eagle,  Rusty Blackbird,
Swainson’s Warbler, and Cerulean Warbler to planning efforts such as Partners in Flight and State Wildlife Action Plans. Industries have carried  out species specific plans and practices on working landscapes such as Habitat Conservation Plans for Northern Spotted Owl and Red-cockaded Woodpecker and forest  management practices such as retention of snags and wildlife trees for Brown-headed Nuthatches and White-headed and  Lewis’s Woodpecker.

In the future, forest  industry partners will continue to engage with partners on science collaborations, coordinated landscape planning, and implementation of bird conservation practices. They will also strive to manage forest  habitats to achieve a range of stand ages and structures to provide proactive benefits for species in steep decline, reducing the potential for state and federal listings. Future  actions will also involve research investments so that science- based recommendations can be used to direct  conservation actions on forestry lands.

CENTRAL HARDWOODS
JOINT VENTURE

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Central  Hardwoods Joint  Venture is a landscape interspersed with grasslands, woodlands, and forests.  Historically, prairie grasses and forbs carpeted the understory of both oak and pine woodlands and contributed greatly  to the region’s overall biodiversity. Fire was the major disturbance that shaped the structure of these ecosystems. After European settlement, forests  and woodlands were almost completely cut down,  and many converted to cropland and pastures. Fires were suppressed decades later to recover timber, especially
in areas  with limited  agricultural use. As a result, the forests  and woodlands of today  are overstocked, and the grassy understory is largely buried under thick leaf litter. Nearly all the native prairies and savannas have been converted to cropland or fescue, a non-native grass  that is less beneficial to grassland birds and other wildlife. Thus, grassland and shrub  species, such as Prairie Warbler, Field Sparrow, Bachman’s Sparrow, and Northern Bobwhite, have suffered notable declines. Joint  Venture partners are restoring native woodland communities for shrub-dependent species through thinning  and prescribed fire, and replanting native warm-season grasses.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Modeling Population Responses To Habitat Fragmentation
Joint  Venture partners developed a set of Geographic Information Systems-based habitat suitability models to estimate the amount of habitat needed to reach  Partners in Flight (PIF) population goals  for more  than  20 priority bird species that breed in forest  and shrublands across  the region. Population viability models were then  used to assess how habitat restoration and/or reforestation, in landscapes with different levels of habitat fragmentation, could  affect the breeding success and future population trends of two Watchlist species: Wood Thrush, which nests  in the forest  interior,  and Prairie Warbler, which nests  in large  shrubland areas  within forested landscapes (Bonnot et al. 2013). Importantly, the models evaluated the effects  of survival rates  during  the non-breeding season on these species as well as breeding season factors.


The Joint Venture focuses on species with the greatest conservation need, such as Prairie Warbler,  that typically have  relatively small ranges,  small population sizes, declining trends, or rely on threatened or degraded habitats.
Results indicated that habitat conservation efforts within less fragmented landscapes resulted in markedly  better population responses. This supports work already  underway to restore hundreds of thousands of acres  of woodlands on or near public lands, with most in some of the least fragmented landscapes in the region. Model results  also indicated that increasing Wood Thrush and
Prairie Warbler survivorship during  the non-breeding season would substantially increase population viability, which supports the full life- cycle approach to bird conservation that PIF is championing.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Central  Valley Joint  Venture encompasses a diverse  landscape that consists
of a vast valley floor, surrounding mountain ranges, and habitats such as wetlands, riparian forest,  grasslands, desert scrub,  and oak woodland. The climate  is Mediterranean, with hot dry summers and mild wet winters.

Historically, the Central  Valley floor was a vast mosaic  of free-flowing  rivers, wetlands, riparian forests,  and native prairie, the majority of which has been destroyed or severely  modified by agriculture and urban  development, which in turn have impacted ecosystem function  and bird populations.

Over its 25-year history, the Joint  Venture partnership has developed a collaborative model for conservation planning that includes waterfowl, shorebirds, and other waterbirds dependent on wetlands as well as landbirds breeding in riparian forest, grassland, and oak savanna. For landbirds, the Joint  Venture has adopted a goal of restoring ecosystems that are capable of supporting self-sustaining and resilient populations. To achieve this goal, the partnership has developed population and habitat objectives for a suite of “focal species” (see Focal Species section on page
99) that represent a range of life histories and specific ecosystem elements. These objectives collectively reflect the state of Central  Valley ecosystems. Habitats restored and enhanced for these focal species will improve  ecosystem function  and, thus benefit other wildlife and the people of California.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Restoring Riparian Forests to Provide  Multiple Benefits
California’s Central  Valley is a place  with many demands—water, wildlife, agriculture, and recreation. It is a transformed landscape, where  creative conservation is needed to reconcile competing demands. Birds provide a valuable lens through which to achieve reconciliation.

The Joint  Venture sets conservation objectives for landbirds that need conservation attention, whether they are at-risk or for which we have a high degree of
stewardship responsibility, and also for their ability to direct  successful restoration of riparian ecosystems for multiple  benefits. Multiple-benefit projects are those whose outcomes address additional conservation targets beyond birds (e.g., fish habitat, erosion control) —they demonstrate how conservation of bird habitats helps
achieve other goals..  Multiple-benefit projects are those whose  outcomes benefit more  than  one  thing—they demonstrate  how conservation of bird habitats helps achieve other goals.

The Joint  Venture aims to protect, restore, and enhance riparian bird and other wildlife habitat while reducing flood risk, providing other services  such as carbon sequestration, and improving recreational opportunities. Since the late 1980s,
more  than  7,000 acres  of riparian habitat have been restored, resulting in significant increases in riparian birds. This restoration has multiple  benefits; at twenty years of age,  these 7,000 acres  of restored riparian forest  can store  the amount of carbon equivalent to the annual  emissions of 15,000 cars.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint  Venture region covers 63 million acres  of diverse  habitats, including pine-dominated forests,  old- growth  deciduous forests,  native prairies and grasslands, and forested and coastal wetlands. Over 300 bird species depend upon these habitats for breeding, migration, and overwintering, with at least 180 species known to breed in the region. The Joint  Venture region once  supported a significant  portion of the longleaf pine woodlands that historically covered over 90 million acres  in the southeastern U.S. Today less than  3 percent remains due  to changes in natural  fire regimes and widespread conversion to loblolly and slash pine communities. In addition, most  of the region’s native grassland habitat continues to be used for agriculture following conversion during  early settlement. As a result, priority habitats
for conservation include  longleaf pine communities, eastern interior grasslands, and freshwater wetlands with an emphasis on bottomland hardwood habitats. The Watchlist species Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Bachman’s Sparrow rank among the highest priority birds, with about 25 percent of their global  populations occurring in the region. Priority grassland species include  Henslow’s Sparrow and Northern Bobwhite, a priority game bird that uses both open pine and grassland habitats.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Restoring Longleaf Pine: A Decision  Support Tool for Managers The Joint  Venture partnership focuses on conserving open pine habitats, especially longleaf pine. These  ecosystems may be dominated by a single species or a mix of longleaf, slash, loblolly,
or shortleaf pine. In their natural  state, these habitats have an open canopy and herbaceous understory needed by many species such as Bachman’s Sparrow, and are maintained by frequent fire. The endangered Watchlist species Red-cockaded Woodpecker also has
specific open pine habitat needs such as large  nesting cavities and an
open mid-story  for foraging. To conserve these important habitats, the Joint  Venture is leveraging the strengths of its many partners to develop science-based planning products that guide land managers on where  and how to maximize benefits to birds and other wildlife.






Conserving open pine  habitats  and managing for their natural state  with an herbaceous understory benefits many birds, including the Northern Bobwhite, and other  wildlife.
For example, in 2016, Joint  Venture partners are releasing an Open Pine Decision  Support Tool, which incorporates habitat information about priority birds and other wildlife, maximizes  conservation efforts on the ground, and determines where  prescribed fire and other management tools can be used to maintain ecosystems for the long term.  In addition, the Joint  Venture is leading an effort among wildlife biologists, fire ecologists, and foresters to identify and describe
forest  conditions that meet the needs of multiple  wildlife species, including reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.

GULF COAST
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Gulf Coast  Joint  Venture encompasses the coastal fringe of marshes, prairies,  bottomland hardwoods, thorn  scrub,  and pine flatwoods stretching from the Texas-Mexico border to the Alabama- Florida border. In addition to supporting 139 species of breeding landbirds, the region is critically important to Neotropical migrants during  spring  and fall migration. Joint  Venture landbird conservation goals  focus on conserving large  blocks of saline-to-brackish marsh for Seaside Sparrow, conserving native grassland-shrublands for numerous species such as Loggerhead Shrike, and conserving coastal forests  that benefit migrant forest  landbirds like, Cerulean
Warbler. These  habitats are subject to a variety of stressors, including outright loss due  to coastal erosion, subsidence, and sea-level rise,
as well as threats such as conversion to row-crop  agriculture and human  development. Joint  Venture partners have developed a prioritization model that identifies  important areas  and forest  patches for migrating forest  landbirds. Additionally,  partners are working to conserve important habitats using a variety of strategies that include providing incentives to private  landowners through the Farm Bill and other programs; managing bird habitat on state, federal, and non- profit conservation lands; and acquiring and restoring habitat with funds from a variety of wetland and coastal habitat programs.

The Swainson’s Warbler is one  of many migratory  species that use vital stopover habitats  within the Joint Venture.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Conserving Stopover Habitat
Partners in Flight’s (PIF's) species priorities  laid the groundwork for the Joint  Venture’s creation of a prioritization model that guides landbird conservation planning and implementation throughout the region. The Joint  Venture used PIF’s Species Assessment and Prioritization  Process to inform selection of a suite of species that
would represent desired components of forest  habitat for migrating landbirds. These  included Cerulean Warbler, a canopy forager; Golden-winged Warbler, a mid-story  forager; and Swainson’s Warbler, an understory forager. Research on these three species
and other Neotropical migrants indicates that large  bottomland hardwood forest  patches are important during  both spring  and fall migration (especially  in the vicinity of Longitude 95 degrees West, and within six miles of the coast). Using these results,  Joint  Venture and Gulf Coast  Bird Observatory staff prioritized forest  migrant stopover habitat for protection and restoration in the region. Larger forest  patches (more than  10,000 acres) within six miles of the Gulf
of Mexico are the highest priority for protection, whereas forest patches that could  be increased to 10,000 or more  acres  are of high priority for restoration. This prioritization scheme is used for both conservation planning and implementation, including ranking North American  Wetland Conservation Act grant  proposals.

USFWS

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Intermountain West Joint  Venture is among the largest and most
ecologically diverse  Joint  Venture in the U.S. It spans portions of 11 western states and 11 Bird Conservation Regions  (BCRs), although is comprised primarily by the Great  Basin, Northern Rockies, and Southern Rockies BCRs. The Intermountain West contains a wide variety of habitats that are important to landbird species during
breeding and nonbreeding seasons. These  habitats vary along                              5
elevational and climatic gradients, and are found  in a diverse                                 15
array of biomes that range from warm and cold deserts to forests
and woodlands to alpine  tundra. Large expanses of land occur
in public ownership yet some of the most  biologically  productive areas  are primarily in private  ownership. The Joint  Venture hosts  a high proportion of the continent's sagebrush-steppe habitat and associated landbird species that occur across  a matrix of federal and private  land ownership. Therefore, sagebrush-steppe conservation is
a high priority for the Joint Venture partnership. Changing land-use

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Restoring Habitat:  Songbirds as Early Indicators of Success Nearly 90% of sagebrush-steppe habitat occurs  in the Joint Venture and many sagebrush obligate bird species exhibit long- term population declines. Concerns over sage-grouse populations have spurred unprecedented focus and investment in sagebrush conservation and management by private  landowners, state and federal natural  resource agencies, and conservation organizations. For example, the Natural  Resources Conservation Service and partnerships have helped conserve over 4.4 million acres  of sage-
steppe habitat. Greater Sage-Grouse have broadly been viewed as an umbrella, or surrogate, species for conserving sagebrush-steppe habitats that are used by other obligate species. This relationship
is particularly evident when conservation measures are targeted at addressing landscape stressors (e.g., fragmentation).







It’s critical to work with private landowners, ranchers,  and farmers to conserve and restore  important habitats needed by species such as Greater
Sage-Grouse.
Over the past  century,  juniper  and pinyon pines  have greatly expanded into historic sagebrush habitats. Conifer removal focused on early and mid-successional sites prevents conversion of sagebrush-steppe to conifer woodlands, and has emerged as a
primary conservation practice for sustaining Greater Sage-Grouse. Recent  research indicates that Brewer’s  Sparrow and Green-tailed Towhee abundance responds positively and strongly  (55–81%) following cuts. This new science demonstrates the utility of songbirds as early indicators of restoration effectiveness, and illustrates  that restorative cuts for sage-grouse that retain  shrub  cover can have immediate benefits for sagebrush species.

LOOKING AHEAD
•    Continue to facilitate  partnerships for strategic sagebrush-steppe conservation.

•   Facilitate  outcome-based evaluations regarding sagebrush obligates and sagebrush-steppe habitat conservation.




























Lewis’s Woodpecker is one  of several declining landbirds  for which the Joint Venture has extremely high stewardship responsibility. While the Joint Venture does not have  the capacity  to work on all priority species, many  of its partners  focus  on additional habitats  important to these birds.

NATIONAL BOBWHITE CONSERVATION INITIATIVE
The National Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI)
is the unified strategic effort of 25 state fish and wildlife
agencies and various conservation organizations,
under the umbrella of the National Bobwhite Technical Committee (NBTC), to restore widespread populations of wild Northern Bobwhite in the U.S. to desired
levels. The products of the NBCI include:  a strategic plan that prioritizes  the landscape for restoration; a GIS-based conservation tool that assists biologists in identifying  and achieving state based objectives; and a coordinated Implementation Plan to monitor the responses of grassland birds to habitat restoration.

One  major objective of NBCI is to conserve and restore native grasslands and savannahs—some of the
Painted  Bunting benefits from NBCI’s
Northern Bobwhite conservation efforts.
most  imperiled ecosystems in North  America. As a result of the significant  loss of these habitats, grassland birds are declining at faster  rates  than  any other community of birds in North  America. In recent years, NBCI and Partners in Flight (PIF) have acknowledged that a suite of conservation activities create suitable habitat for multiple  priority species, including game and nongame birds. By working together, members of NBCI and PIF leverage resources, knowledge, and experience to address the decline of grassland birds.

In 2016, at the urging  of NBCI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency
(FSA) approved stand-alone eligibility for corners of center pivot-irrigated crop fields into
the Continuous Conservation Reserve  Program (CCRP). The FSA authorized 250,000 acres  for
enrollment of pivot corners into the CCRP CP33 field border practice. This $250 million wildlife conservation value is primarily the result of leadership by NBCI and the NBTC. The practice pays producers to transform center pivot corners into quality bird habitat. In pivot-dominated landscapes, marginal  corners can comprise more  than  20% of the landscape acreage, and thus has the potential to support  Northern Bobwhite and a suite of other priority species, including Painted Bunting, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Field Sparrow, Loggerhead Shrike, and Dickcissel.











Dickcissel may benefit from the conversion of pivot corners into quality habitat.
In the future NBCI will continue its work to influence  federal agricultural policy to help restore native grassland habitat. Restoring healthy  forests  on public and private  lands by promoting active management, such as thinning  and prescribed fire, will remain  a priority. And finally, NBCI plans to develop central information services  to help partners document, monitor, and publicize  progress and successes, thus building a stronger collective movement.

LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
JOINT VENTURE

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Lower Mississippi Valley Joint  Venture is composed of two distinctly different ecological landscapes—the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) and the West Gulf Coastal Plains/Ouachitas. The Mississippi Alluvial Valley was once  the largest and most  productive forested wetland ecosystem in North  America. But today  less than one-third of the region’s historic forest  acreage remains. In the
West Gulf Coastal Plains/Ouachitas, forested wetland and open pine habitats are threatened by many landscape changes such as reservoir creation that alters hydrology, conversion of native habitats to densely-planted pine plantations, and loss of relatively frequent fire. Combining Joint  Venture science and partner-led reforestation actions, the region has experienced a net gain of over one  million acres  of forested habitat since 1992. Partners are also engaged  in encouraging forest  landowners to carry out management practices that maintain forest  health, sustainable economic return,  and quality wildlife habitat. Partners are cooperating through Conservation Delivery Networks to use the best available  science to identify
places on the landscape that will provide the greatest conservation benefits to priority Watch List species such as Prothonotary Warbler, Kentucky  Warbler, Wood Thrush,  Bachman’s Sparrow, and  Red- cockaded Woodpecker.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Gaining Ground for Birds
One  primary focus of Joint  Venture partners is to protect, manage, and restore forest  in ways that build large,  contiguous forested areas or “core forest” needed by many landbird species. Core forest  has
a 250-meter buffer against surrounding unsuitable habitats and
is the basic building block of priority bird habitat in the MAV. This key understanding of the birds’ biology  was incorporated into a landscape-scale Forest  Breeding Bird Decision  Support Model, which public land management agencies and non-governmental organization partners use to target acquisition, protection, and reforestation efforts that maximize benefits to priority bird species such as Swallow-tailed Kite, Prothonotary Warbler, and Cerulean
Warbler. To date approximately one  million acres  of forest  have been restored.






Area-sensitive forest  species, such
as Swallow-tailed Kite, were used to identify  “core forest” areas in the Joint Venture.
This model has directly impacted habitat conservation delivery programs. For example, it has been used in ranking applications for funding through the Wetlands Reserve  Program (WRP) by identifying tracts  within high priority reforestation areas.  As a result, the WRP has supported the reforestation of over 700,000 acres  within the MAV—a
10% increase in available  habitat for priority bird species—most of which (more than  500,000 acres) has been strategically placed to help build core forest.

NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Northern Great  Plains Joint  Venture covers portions of four states bounded on the north  and east  by the Missouri River as it flows from Montana south  through the Dakotas. It encompasses the majority of the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region.  The Yellowstone River, the longest undammed river in the country,  flows
more  than  450 miles across  the Montana portion of the Joint  Venture, and supports extensive cottonwood gallery, riparian shrubland, and riverine habitats inhabited by Black-billed  Cuckoo, Red-headed Woodpecker and Spotted Towhee. Water diversion,  bank armoring, and transportation infrastructure threaten natural  hydrologic function and habitat diversity in the region. Forming  the core of the range of many declining priority landbirds such as Lark Bunting  and Chestnut- collared Longspur, the Joint  Venture includes some of the most
intact  prairie landscapes in the Great  Plains. Expanding development of coal, oil, and wind resources threaten to fragment these prairie
bird habitats, particularly in Greater Sage-Grouse core breeding areas  in Montana and Wyoming.  The primary driver of habitat change in the region has been the conversion of rangeland to tilled agricultural crops  such as corn, soybeans, and wheat.

To address these impacts and threats, Joint  Venture partners are developing conservation design and decision support tools that enhance the capability  of landowners to undertake sustainable ranching. For example, decision support tools include  improved spatial  models of species distributions, habitats, and threats of Watch List species. Partners are also working to maintain landscape resiliency by improving the quality and quantity of riparian and wetland habitats across  the Joint  Venture through improved grazing practices and habitat buffers.









Declining  species such as Lark Bunting need an intact prairie landscape.

















The  Plowprint Tool is helping to achieve Joint Venture goals for rangeland management benefiting grassland  birds such as Chestnut-collared Longspur.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Use of the  “Plowprint”  to Guide  and Monitor Landscape Change The Joint  Venture is focused on enhancing the ability of working landscapes to sustain  populations of priority landbirds. Joint  Venture partners are using a map  of the cumulative “plowprint” of all lands cultivated for crop production as a tool for targeting conservation and monitoring landscape change. Spearheaded by the World Wildlife Fund, this tool has helped identify focal counties where enhanced Farm Bill delivery and other approaches might  best achieve Joint  Venture goals  of sustainable rangeland management. Joint  Venture partners are funding and hiring partner biologists who provide technical assistance to Natural  Resources Conservation Service office staff in priority counties. Priority areas  for their efforts are defined by the plowprint tool and species models for Chestnut- collared Longspur, Sprague’s Pipit, and other grassland and sagebrush obligates.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE



Joint Venture Boundary

The Oaks and Prairies Joint  Venture encompasses three unique
Bird Conservation Regions  (BCR)—the Edwards  Plateau, the Oaks and Prairies, and a small portion of the Eastern  Tallgrass Prairie. Covering nearly 14 million acres,  the Edwards  Plateau region is the southernmost extension of the Great  Plains. The region’s native vegetation of mesquite, juniper,  and oak savannas and woodlands is the core breeding range of the endangered Black-capped Vireo and Golden-cheeked Warbler. The Oaks and Prairies BCR encompasses
45 million acres  that,  historically, were predominantly large  tallgrass prairie patches intermixed with patches of shrub  and forest  habitats. On the ridges in the Cross Timbers region, large  tracts  of ancient deciduous forests  were left on rugged escarpments and steep terrain that were unsuitable for farming, creating one  of  largest tracts  of old- growth  forest  in the U.S. Urbanization highly impacts this region;  the region holds  over 14 million people and has 7 of the largest 50 cities in the U.S. Agriculture dominates about 80% of the landscape, about half is cropland and the other half is grazing  land. Few natural  lakes exist in the region, but artificial water bodies, such as reservoirs  and stock tanks, are abundant and have transformed the dry-land  savanna into an area  rich with seasonal and permanent water sources.

The Joint Venture works to protect and restore  grassland  and shrubland habitat to benefit species that have  restricted breeding ranges  and small populations, like Black-capped Vireo, as well as wide ranging  common species in serious decline such as Eastern Meadowlark.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Getting a “GRIP” on Grassland  Bird Conservation
The Joint  Venture initiated the Grassland Restoration Incentive Program (GRIP) in 2013, with contributions from corporate, state, and non-governmental organizations, such as local Quail Coalition chapters, to provide incentive payments to private  landowners for grassland species management. GRIP works in parallel  with U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Bill Conservation Programs to help target priority conservation where  this and other federal programs cannot reach.  It provides an opportunity for private  and state
resources to augment federal money  for on-the-ground conservation incentives. Joint  Venture planning efforts help guide the process
and are based on population and habitat objectives from Partners in Flight. Thus far, over 45,000 acres  of habitat have been improved through 75 enrolled projects. GRIP is supported by over 3,000 bird point  counts that provide county-scale grassland and shrubland breeding bird monitoring, and a strategic communications effort to reach  partner biologists and target landowners in focus areas.  This partner effort ties planning, delivery, communications, monitoring, and research together for a strategic and adaptive approach for conservation.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
Pacific Birds Habitat Joint  Venture is an international Joint  Venture                                   1                 3
that includes Alaska, the western portions of British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon, and northern California, and the Hawaiian and                                2                  4
other Pacific Islands. It encompasses several  avifaunal biomes and
a diversity of habitat types  such as arctic and alpine  tundra, forests, wetlands, prairies,  and islands and atolls. Several species of landbirds are entirely or largely restricted to this region, including McKay’s Bunting  and Sooty  Grouse. Multiple landbird conservation efforts
are underway in the Joint  Venture, from the boreal forest  to the oaks                                                          5
and prairies of the Pacific Northwest. Increasing climate  effects  across the boreal zone  are prompting new efforts to assess the vulnerability of habitats and establish trans-border monitoring programs in
Alaska and Canada. Oak and prairie habitat is now among the
Pacific Northwest’s most  threatened landbird habitats. Cleared for
agriculture and urban  development, crowded out by conifers  in the                  Joint Venture Boundary                           9
absence of periodic fire, and facing uncertain prospects in a changing
climate,  oak habitats provide a dwindling  base for many species. In addition, the integrity  of coastal habitats are threatened by rising sea levels, increasing storm  frequency and intensity,  and altered erosion and deposition.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Oak and Prairie Collaborative Conservation
Joint  Venture partners in the region are directly contributing to the conservation of priority landbird species that depend on oak and prairie habitats, especially in the Willamette Valley, Puget Trough and the Georgia Basin, where  habitat losses  have been greatest. Quercus and Aves is an international effort led by the American Bird Conservancy to conserve Pacific Coast  priority oak-associated birds and their breeding habitats as well as their wintering  habitats in Mexico and Central  America. Many Joint  Venture partners have raised  millions of dollars to match  Neotropical Migratory  Bird Conservation Act grant  funds that support this work.












Winter surveys  in pine-oak and cloud forests  include  Hermit Warbler.
Landscape-scale restoration projects are ongoing in southern
Oregon and northern California, where  there are similar threats
to existing  oak and prairie habitat but relatively less direct  habitat loss. Accomplishments include:  four land acquisitions in the U.S. of approximately 1,200 acres; three acquisitions in El Salvador  of approximately 120 acres; nearly 40,000 acres  of private  reserves in
Guatemala and Costa  Rica; and habitat management and restoration on over 450 acres  at 20 sites in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Bird monitoring and research is occurring at more  than
100 sites in California, Oregon, and Washington as are inventories for the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler at numerous sites in
Latin America.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE



Joint Venture Boundary
PLJV
The Playa Lakes Joint  Venture extends from western Nebraska south
through the Texas panhandle, and is comprised of native short and mixed-grass prairies and shrublands, bisected by a few large  river systems. Although the 140 million-acre  area  does not contain a high diversity of habitats, it supports over 520 species of birds during some portion of their life-cycle. The Joint  Venture is the only place  in
the world where  one  still can see  the spectacular breeding displays  of the Lesser  Prairie-Chicken.

The birdlife of the western Great  Plains is often  cited  as having the
steepest and most  consistent declines of any guild in North  America.             18
Examples of declining species include  Northern Harrier,  Loggerhead
Shrike, Cassin’s  Sparrow, McCown’s  Longspur, Lark Bunting, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher and Western Meadowlark. The Joint Venture supports significant  migrant and wintering  populations of many grassland birds, and is critical to maintaining linkages  between
breeding areas  in the northern plains and wintering  areas  as far south as the pampas in Argentina.

The most  numerous wetlands throughout the Joint  Venture area  are playas—shallow ephemeral wetlands
each  of which occurs  at the lowest point  in an individual watershed. These  playas, along  with wetlands such as
Cheyenne Bottoms, support continentally important populations of birds.





















Farm Bill biologist Kelsi Wehrman and landowner Mark Ohmstede discuss
a Farm Bill conservation project in
Nebraska.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Crafting a Landscape That Works for Birds and People
One  of the primary ways the Joint  Venture can affect conservation is through the use of U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Bill conservation programs, such as the Conservation Reserve  Program (CRP), which gives incentives to landowners to carry out a variety of practices that support the conversion of cropland back to grassland. The Joint  Venture and its partners have used many different methods to reach  landowners, including direct  mailings in targeted areas,
radio advertising, and landowner workshops. The Joint  Venture partnership has supported positions for private  lands biologists who match  landowners with suitable conservation practices that best fit the landowners’ personal goals.  It has also used its planning and
conservation design capabilities to identify priority areas  for targeting enrollment of CRP grasslands.

For the past  25 years, through its ConocoPhillips grant  program, the Joint  Venture has awarded nearly $2.5 million in grants which have supported more  than  150 conservation projects throughout the region and affected over 68,000 acres  of bird habitat—much of that in grasslands. In addition, it offers capacity  grants to increase the ongoing ability of programs or organizations to develop and deliver habitat conservation, even after funding has stopped.

•   Institute a region-wide integrated monitoring program with a sampling design to generate the data needed to address continued population declines, shifting species ranges, and effectiveness of habitat management.

•   Based  on the integrated monitoring program,
determine significant  bird population trends at local scales,  provide information to develop decision support tools,  and evaluate conservation treatments.






Bird monitoring will help  support conservation for declining species such as the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher.

PRAIRIE POTHOLE
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Prairie Pothole Joint  Venture encompasses one-third or 100,000
square miles of North  America’s Prairie Pothole Region  (PPR).
Its uniqueness lies in the millions of small depressional wetlands that constitute one  of the richest wetland systems in the world.

breeding habitat for a diversity of wetland and grassland birds,
including more  than  half of North  America’s waterfowl population                                                                23
and 189 landbird species. Significant numbers of spring  and fall
migrants also use these productive habitats.

Temperate grasslands within the Joint  Venture are among the earth’s                                                             22
most  imperiled ecosystems. Conversion of grasslands into other
uses occurs  faster  than  conservation actions can respond. Many
prairie landbird populations have declined drastically since the 1960s. Some  have stabilized, but a small group of grassland nesting birds in the Joint  Venture continues to decline. Species within this group are Partners in Flight Watchlist species, including Sprague’s Pipit, Baird’s Sparrow, Chestnut-collared Longspur, and McCown’s Longspur. Two  high priorities  for Joint  Venture partners are to better understand population limiting factors  of these species and restore grassland nesting habitat to address their decline.


CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Partnering for Sprague’s Pipit Conservation
Sprague’s Pipit populations are declining sharply and consistently. A petition to list this species as federally  threatened or endangered resulted in work on a distribution model, which was published in
2015, to inform the species status  assessment. The model was developed in cooperation with the University of Montana and Joint Venture partners. It is the first successful attempt at building an international model for non-game species between Canadian and U.S. partners in the PPR.














Sprague’s Pipit is one  of several steeply declining grassland  specialists that depend on native  prairie habitats  for breeding. The vast majority of their remaining habitat  is on private  lands.
Model  results  indicate that high percentages of breeding Sprague’s Pipit populations occur in small areas  of their total geographic breeding range. At least 80% of the entire  breeding population occurs  on private  land, which resulted in a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) program with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Joint  Venture partners. The CCAA provides incentives for landowners to engage in voluntary conservation activities that can prevent Endangered Species Act listing of this species. Furthermore, a CCAA provides participating property owners  with a permit containing assurances that if they engage in certain  conservation actions for species included in the agreement, they will not be required to implement additional conservation measures beyond those in the CCAA.

•   Expand knowledge of the demographics of priority breeding grassland birds to facilitate  strategic habitat conservation.

•    Develop full life-cycle models to understand what portion of the annual  cycle to focus conservation and address population limiting factors.

•   Provide research that better defines the landscape
characteristics associated with the density  and distribution
of breeding grassland bird populations, enabling population
objectives to be directly tied to conservation actions.                       Working  with private  landowners is imperative to grassland  conservation.

RAINWATER BASIN
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Rainwater  Basin Joint  Venture contains over 2.3 million acres of wetlands and over 20 million acres  of grasslands—including the Sandhills region of Nebraska, one  of the largest intact  grass-
stabilized dune systems in the world. The Sandhills provide prime breeding habitat for Greater  Prairie-Chicken, Eastern Meadowlark, and Grasshopper Sparrow, all priority landbird species. In addition, the Rainwater  Basin Wetland Complex and Central  Platte  River provide critical spring  stopover habitat for millions of migrating waterfowl, 40 species of shorebirds, and over 500,000 Sandhill Cranes. Woodlands, generally confined to drainages of the major river systems, provide breeding habitat for priority species such
as Baltimore Oriole,  Red-headed Woodpecker, and Black-billed
Cuckoo.

Outside of the Sandhills, much of the tallgrass  and mixed-grass prairie grasslands have now been converted to row-crop  agriculture. Those  that remain  are subject to wind or water erosion or are often  integrated into haying and grazing  operations, which depending on timing and intensity,  can significantly impact  wildlife habitat value. To address threats and achieve population and habitat goals  for 19 priority landbird species Joint  Venture partners are employing two main strategies: reducing grassland fragmentation by removing 220,000 acres  of invasive Eastern  Red Cedar and adding new grassland acreage in four geographic focus areas  through enrollment in easement programs.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Restoring Fire on the  Landscape
Following a century  of successful fire suppression campaigns, eastern red cedar is now invading  over 40,000 acres  of Nebraska grasslands annually, including more  than  11% of the 2.3 million acres  of mixed-grass prairie within the Central  Loess Hills Ecoregion. The woody plant  encroachment not only fragments and degrades habitat for species like Greater  Prairie-Chicken, it also substantially reduces forage capacity, undermining local livestock economies. A grassland management strategy of carrying out over two thousand 200-acre  prescribed fires every year would be needed to mitigate the current  rate of invasive tree  encroachment. Clearly larger  fires on a landscape scale are needed to sustain  grasslands for livestock and wildlife.

In 2014, the Joint  Venture was awarded a grant  to extend and enhance the highly successful Prescribed Fire Training Exchange (TREX) in the Central  Loess Hills. The TREX program provides professional firefighters  with hands-on training  hosted on up to 5,000 contiguous acres  of privately-owned grassland. Funding from the Nebraska Environmental Trust is used to enhance the ecological effects  of these prescribed fires by providing financial incentives for livestock grazing  deferments and mechanical tree  removal.  In addition, areas  targeted for the TREX are derived from the Joint  Venture’s Greater  Prairie-Chicken distribution models that predict hotspots where  local habitat management can have the biggest benefit.

Since the inception of the TREX program, wildland firefighters  from the U.S., South  Africa, Mexico, and Spain have burned over 20,000 acres  within the Central  Loess Hills. In 2014, landowners signed voluntary agreements to perform 322 acres  of invasive tree  removal,  615 acres  of half-season and 61 acres  of full-season livestock
grazing  deferment within the 2015 TREX area.  A recent survey of participating landowners estimated a reduction in Eastern  Red Cedar (on a 1-10 scale) from 8.3 to 3.4 following the TREX. The landowners estimated a savings
of over $40,000 in red cedar control  over the next 5-10 years, and reported increases in mule deer and Northern
Bobwhite numbers.

Surveys  on Greater Prairie-Chicken leks were used to identify  habitat  variables needed to predict species occurrence throughout Nebraska and to determine areas for prescribed burning.


LOOKING AHEAD
•   Update population objectives and develop species distribution models for all 19 priority landbird species in order to identify opportunities where  habitat restoration or improvement will have the greatest impact.

•   Assess the effectiveness of invasive species removal  and Conservation Reserve  Program enrollment strategies in order to refine conservation benchmarks or develop additional grassland conservation strategies.


Landscape-scale fires covering thousands of acres of grasslands, a regular occurrence prior to European settlement of the Great Plains, are now being restored to deter invasive woody plant encroachment.

RIO GRANDE
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Rio Grande Joint  Venture geography encompasses a range of habitats, from oak forests  and brush  to coastal prairie and barrier islands to montane ponderosa pine forests  and grassland habitat of the Chihuahuan Desert. Over 700 species of birds have been found  in the region and 75% are landbirds. Joint  Venture work in these areas  target a suite of grassland birds, including Sprague’s Pipit and Chestnut-collared Longspur. Joint  Venture partners are
improving range condition by adjusting grazing  regimes and helping landowners reduce reliance on non-native grasses and cope with drought. Throughout the region, riparian corridors are a priority for Rose-throated Becard and Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Riparian zones  are impacted by changing water availability, invasive species, grazing  in the flood zone, and habitat loss.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Partnering for Grassland  Conservation in the
Valles Centrales of Mexico
The globally significant  grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert provide winter habitat for many declining Great  Plains grassland birds, including Baird’s Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow, Sprague’s Pipit, Chestnut-collared Longspur, and McCown’s  Longspur. The grasslands of Valles Centrales are facing significant  threats from
inappropriate grazing  regimes, land-use change for agriculture, brush and tree  invasion, and drought.














Grassland birds, such as Grasshopper Sparrow,  have  lost habitat  in the Chihuahuan grasslands due  to brush encroachment and conversion to agriculture  or urbanization. Partners are working  to improve existing conditions and reduce reliance on non-native grasses  for grazing.
The Joint  Venture was instrumental in providing resources to create an extensive dataset to analyze bird distribution, abundance and habitat use. That foundation served as the groundwork for the Chihuahuan Desert Grassland Bird Conservation Plan. This plan became a significant  mechanism to provide landowners with technical guidance to help them  improve  grassland conditions through better management practices. Restored grasslands provide improved habitat conditions for wintering  priority grassland birds, while benefiting ranchers through increased income.

The Joint  Venture partnership obtained funding from a variety of sources to carry out models of sustainable cattle  ranching. The models promote the restoration and conservation of grasslands, increase income and profit for ranchers, and provide more  and better quality habitat for grasslands birds and other wildlife. After several years of this collaborative work, the Joint  Venture has impacted
290,000 acres.

Bureau of Land Management

BIRD CONSERVATION ON PUBLIC LANDS IN THE UNITED STATES
In the western U.S., publicly owned land is widespread,  including, for
example, 65% of Alaska. Although public ownership is less common in the eastern and central  U.S., many important parks, forests,  and refuges in those regions are managed by state and federal agencies. In 2011,  U.S. State  of the Birds Report  on Public Lands highlighted the tremendous stewardship responsibilities and opportunities for bird conservation on more  than  850 million acres  of U.S. public lands.

The two largest public land agencies in the U.S. are the Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest  Service, together managing nearly 440 million acres.  Both are multi-purpose agencies meaning bird conservation must be balanced with other land uses such as grazing,  logging, mineral  exploration, energy development, and recreation. In an era when habitat management is required to










More than half of the breeding population of Sage  Thrasher occurs
on BLM-managed lands. Therefore, BLM efforts
to improve sagebrush habitat  can halt the declines of this species.
provide the full variety of habitats used by birds, opportunities to use logging and grazing  as conservation tools—rather than  just for economic benefits—may allow the multi-use agencies to contribute as much to bird conservation as those for whom conservation is a higher  priority.

Because of the highly uneven distribution of public lands across  the U.S., certain  habitats and
the birds associated with them,  are disproportionately represented on these lands. For example, about 86% of arctic and alpine  tundra bird distributions are on public lands, including extensive BLM lands in Alaska. Public lands also support more  than  half the breeding distributions across  36 aridland specialists, with BLM having lead  stewardship for a very large  proportion of Sage  Sparrow (67%), Sage  Thrasher (63%), and Greater Sage-Grouse (59%).

Similarly, 33% of bird distributions in Mexican pine-oak forests,  34% of distributions across  41 other Western forest  species, and 70% of alpine  habitat in the contiguous United  States (not
including Alaska) are found  on Forest  Service land. Thus, conservation of these groups of birds will require Forest Service leadership. Examples include  Black and Brown- capped Rosy-Finches in alpine  tundra and Dusky Grouse and White-headed Woodpecker in western forest.









Black Rosey-finch has one  of the smallest  and most specialized ranges  of all North  American birds, and may lose much  of its current habitat  in the face of climate  change.
Parters  in Flight's  (PIF) multi-species, science-based approach can serve as a catalyst  for improving ecosystem management on public lands. PIF population and habitat objectives and data from bird monitoring can be used
to assess management needs, set measurable targets, design management to meet these targets, and measure the effectiveness of actions. To take advantage of these opportunities for bird and ecosystem conservation on public lands, all U.S. land management agencies will need additional resources, more  public support for conservation, and better collaboration among multiple  stakeholders.

SAN FRANCISCO BAY
JOINT VENTURE







BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The San Francisco  Bay Joint  Venture is a partnership working to protect, restore, and enhance all kinds of wetlands and riparian habitats for the benefit of wildlife and people in the Bay Area. Although small in geographic territory compared to other Joint Ventures, it incorporates areas  that are widely recognized as among North  America’s most  ecologically important. The Joint  Venture includes three Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance (San Francisco  Bay Estuary, Bolinas Lagoon, and Tomales Bay), two Western Hemisphere Reserve  Network  sites (San Francisco  Bay
Estuary Hemispheric Reserve  and Bolinas Lagoon),  and a high density of Audubon Important Bird Areas.

Despite losing one  third of its area  and approximately 85% of its
wetlands to development, agricultural and salt flat conversion, and fill,
the San Francisco  Bay Estuary remains critically important ecologically. In the highly urbanized San Francisco
Bay Area, the wetlands provide ecological services  such as flood protection, water quality maintenance, nutrient filtration and cycling, and carbon sequestration.

Of the Joint  Venture’s six planning regions, four are within the San Francisco  Bay Estuary, while the others include the coast  and coastal estuaries and the Russian River watershed. Much of the Joint  Venture’s habitat work has occurred within the San Francisco  Bay Estuary, the largest estuary  on the Pacific Coast  of the U.S., and one  of
the most  important nationally  for wildlife. The Estuary was historically rimmed with tidal salt marshes, particularly its northern and southern reaches. The marshes, vegetated with specialized plants  adapted to salty water, provide important habitat for over 1,000 species of animals such as young  salmon  and other fish, rails, songbirds, shorebirds, egrets and herons, ducks, the endangered endemic salt marsh harvest  mouse, and other species of conservation concern.





















The Joint Venture has several of the largest  tidal wetland restoration projects in the country,  including the 14,500-acre South  Bay Salt Pond Project, which is restoring the former industrial salt ponds to tidal and managed wetland habitats.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Reversing Wetland Habitat Loss
The Joint  Venture was founded in 1996 to reverse the trend in habitat loss and restore wetland habitats. Since 1997, Joint  Venture partners have completed over 150 wetland habitat projects, resulting in conservation actions on over
70,000 acres.  This work has contributed to stabilizing  bird populations in the region. General findings in the first regional  State  of the Birds Report  indicated that over the last 20 years, most  bird populations have been stable. Riparian birds, for example,
have increased: however, grassland and coastal sage scrub/chaparral birds are losing habitat.

LOOKING AHEAD
•   Prioritize the protection of habitat migration space and restore transitional habitats that will provide habitat values now and allow for future marsh and species migration.

•   Provide science, conservation, and policy support to partners now to make critical investments that will perpetuate full ecosystem functions.


•    Continue to use the Joint  Venture’s Climate  Adaptation Decision
Support planning and decision models to identify target species and key conservation actions on the landscape.

•   Predict  the best places to restore marshes through a multi-species approach to assessing tidal marsh resilience under different sea-level rise scenarios.


•   Further  develop a climate  adaptation plan for San Pablo  Bay National
Wildlife Refuge  as a possible model for other regions of the Joint  Venture.

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Sonoran Joint  Venture, the first bi-national Joint  Venture with
Mexico, is an international partnership of diverse  organizations                          32
working together to conserve the unique birds and habitats of the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico. The Joint  Venture
includes all or parts  of nine states in the two countries as well as                                               33
the Gulf of California and its islands.  Elevation  in the Joint  Venture ranges from below  sea level at the Salton  Sea to over 9,000 feet in
the mountains. This region’s diverse  habitats support approximately                                                34
650 regularly occurring species that breed, winter, or migrate through
the area.  The Joint  Venture has high stewardship responsibility for
26 species—over 50% of the world’s population of these birds occurs
within its boundaries (see side bar). The Joint  Venture is also culturally
diverse,  with more  than  25 indigenous tribes  and nations living in the               Joint Venture Boundary
region.

A large  percent of Joint  Venture lands in the U.S. is publicly owned and managed by state and federal agencies, including the Bureau  of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest  Service (USFS), Department of Defense, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In Mexico, much of the land is private,  although a number of protected areas  are managed by state and federal agencies. Climate  change, habitat loss and degradation, alternative energy development, invasive species,
water management, and grazing  management are some of the major challenges facing landbirds in the Joint  Venture region.

Bendire’s Thrasher populations are predicted to decrease by 50% by 2033, if current trends continue.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Planning for Bird Conservation in an Uncertain  Future
Birds are closely linked to climate  and vegetation and, as a result, can provide early warnings  of broader changes to come. The Joint Venture’s interactive, online decision support tool,  PLuMA (Planning for Landscape Management and Action/Planeación para  el Manejo y Adaptación de Paisajes), was developed in partnership with Point Blue Conservation Science to help land managers visualize the
projected impacts of a changing climate  on birds and their habitats. PLuMA lets land managers see  what the future might  hold for birds, to help make better decisions about what management actions
to take. This tool is a foundation for monitoring environmental change for the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, evaluating climate  change impacts and determining if land management and adaptation strategies are making a difference for birds and their habitats. Among  the 67 species modeled are Partners in Flight Watch List birds: Bendire’s Thrasher, Le Conte’s Thrasher, Wrentit, Band- tailed Pigeon, and California  Thrasher.

LOOKING AHEAD
•   Implement long-term coordinated bird and habitat monitoring across  the region to track climate  impacts and other wide-scale stressors.

•    Address the most  pressing issues facing birds in the Joint Venture, such as climate  change, habitat loss, and invasive species, by implementing the results  of a multi-year  strategic conservation planning effort, guided by the  Open Standards  for the Practice  of Conservation.

•    Develop bird and habitat accounts, geared toward land management agencies like the BLM and USFS, as well as those who work with private  landowners.

UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER/ GREAT LAKES REGION
JOINT VENTURE




BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
Most of the Upper  Mississippi River and Great  Lakes Region  Joint Venture landscape is used for crop production (39%), but forest communities occupy  26% of the area,  and include  boreal evergreen and mixed hardwoods, boreal hardwood transition, deciduous Big Woods remnants, oak woodlands, savannas, and river floodplain forests.  Grasslands and pastures comprise another 18% of the
area,  including the Flint Hills of Kansas and Nebraska—one of the last strongholds of tallgrass  prairie on the continent. More than
500 species of birds breed, winter, or migrate through the region. The Joint  Venture is especially important for three Watch List species: most  of the global  populations of Kirtland’s Warbler (99%) and Golden-winged Warbler (75%) breed in the relatively intact northern forests  of Bird Conservation Region  (BCR) 12, and 53% of the world’s Henslow’s Sparrow persist in increasingly small prairie remnants scattered throughout BCRs 22 and 23. Habitat loss due
to urbanization and conversion to row-crop  agriculture remains the
greatest threat to the region’s birds. Habitat degradation through

forest  fragmentation and invasive species, and increasing human-caused mortality from collisions with structures and domestic cat predation, are also significant  threats. To help offset some of these losses,  partners within the Joint  Venture have protected, restored, and enhanced more  than  820,000 acres  of habitat since the completion of their 2007 Implementation Plan.






















Volunteers and professional banders work together at the Navarre banding station  on the south  shore  of Lake Erie to assess  landbird  migrant  molt  and body condition.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Monitoring Landbird Migration
Millions of landbirds pass  through the Joint  Venture each  spring  and fall. These  migrants are concentrated by weather events along  8,000 miles of Great  Lakes shoreline or by cover and foraging opportunities in wetlands and forests  along  7,000 miles of the Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, and Ohio Rivers. Since 2009, the Joint  Venture Science
Team has partnered with the Midwest  Coordinated Bird Monitoring Partnership to fill key information needs and to monitor progress on management projects. A partnership working group, the Midwest Landbird  Migration  Monitoring Network,  coalesced in 2011, to coordinate bird observatory, monitoring station, and academic
and organizational research program efforts to better understand landbird migration ecology in the Midwest,  and to develop effective decision support tools and migration conservation strategies. This network  is working to address challenges posed by human-caused obstacles to migration, to determine location and site characteristics of optimal stopover habitat, and to share  information and protocols so that migration data are available  to address questions at multiple temporal and spatial  scales.  Recent  projects involve incorporating migration survival data into full life-cycle models for select Watch
List species, and the integration of stopover site modeling with other tools in the  Midwest  Avian Data Center to prioritize sites for protection and restoration, based on migratory landbird movements.

STEWARDSHIP OF BIRDS IN THE BOREAL NURSERY
The boreal region is home to one  of the
greatest extents of the world’s remaining forest.  This enormous forested biome produces a huge abundance of birds: at the end  of each  breeding season, several billion birds migrate out of the boreal to countries throughout the hemisphere.  At least 21 species have more  than  80% of their breeding population in the boreal forest,  and therefore the region has an extremely high stewardship responsibility for these species.

Despite the number of birds produced in the boreal forest,  this region has often  been ranked as a low priority for
immediate landbird conservation action. The boreal supports relatively few Watch List, endangered, or endemic species, and because of its immense size, its
bird species typically have extensive

distributions and relatively large  population sizes that lower their scores in the Partners in Flight (PIF) assessment process. However,  several  boreal species, such as the Wilson’s Warbler (pictured above),  are recognized by PIF as Common Birds in Steep Decline  (see page 11). Moreover,
analysis of Breeding Bird Survey data suggest that the boreal forest

CANADIAN ARCTIC
REGION

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Arctic Region  spans the far northern portion of the continent from Alaska to Labrador, corresponding to Bird Conservation Region
3, Arctic Plains and Mountains. Habitats are diverse  and include  arctic tundra, sparse taiga  forests,  wet coastal sedge and grass  meadows, gravel barrens, glaciers, alpine  landscapes, and a high density  of
small and medium-sized lakes. A total of 153 bird species breed across  the region, including 64 landbirds. Some,  like the Harris’s Sparrow—Canada’s only endemic breeding landbird—do not nest anywhere else in North  America.

This portion of Canada’s north  is sparsely  populated with around
50,000 residents, predominantly Indigenous People. Development in the region has a limited  footprint since the main human  activities are subsistence hunting, trapping, and some commercial mining. Most of the threats to arctic landbirds arise outside of the region, for example, anthropogenic climate  change, degradation of tundra
habitats from over-abundant waterfowl, and long-range transport and deposition of contaminants. Thus, the  main challenge in addressing arctic  landbird conservation is to engage people whose activities affect a region they  will likely never visit.

Large gaps in knowledge of species distribution, abundance, and population trends also complicate efforts to conserve the birds and habitats in arctic Canada. Monitoring in this vast and remote area
is difficult, especially given often  challenging weather conditions. Migration  and wintering  ground survey counts provide information for some arctic landbirds, but these counts can be imprecise, in part because they can be affected if birds shift their wintering  distribution or migration behavior in response to weather or climate  change.



Few data are available from the Arctic Region for landbirds, such as this Horned Lark; thus data from more southerly regions are often substituted.




















Arctic PRISM surveys  include  landbirds such as Snow  Bunting.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Using Shorebirds to Monitor Landbirds
While the Arctic Program for Regional  and International Shorebird Monitoring (Arctic PRISM) is designed to focus on 26 species of shorebirds that breed primarily in the arctic, the program’s scientists also collect  data on all bird species they encounter. These  data
are extremely valuable in a region without  other formal landbird surveys. Arctic PRISM’s all-inclusive approach to monitoring has produced statistically reliable  population estimates for a number of arctic-breeding songbird species, including Snow Bunting,  Lapland Longspur, Hoary  Redpoll  and Savannah Sparrow. Analysis of information acquired through Arctic PRISM helps  determine range and habitat associations, the cause of declines, and provides a much needed baseline against which to measure future change.

CANADIAN INTERMOUNTAIN
JOINT VENTURE





©Jeff Wallaca

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Canadian Intermountain Joint  Venture includes the Canadian portions of the Great  Basin and Northern Rockies Bird Conservation Regions  (BCRs 9 and 10). The region covers the Columbia and Rocky Mountains from the Canada-U.S. border to the southern edge of the boreal forest,  and the central  plateau in interior British Columbia to the Coast  Mountains, as well as the Great  Basin. This region contains extremes and contrasts in topography and climate,  which combine
to create a tremendous variety of habitat types  in close proximity, including lakes and ponds, wetlands, riparian areas,  grasslands, shrub-steppe, dry and moist coniferous forests,  and alpine  tundra. Some  of these ecosystems are found  nowhere else in Canada. This variety results  in 280 bird species that regularly breed, overwinter, or reside year-round within the region, including 189 landbirds—a
disproportionately high number of which are considered at risk such as Lewis’s Woodpecker and Black Swift.

Loss and  degradation of forest habitats through logging and massive changes in forest  structure, due  to the Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak and fire suppression, are affecting numerous species. Habitat loss and degradation from agricultural practices are also significant  due  to the booming viticulture (wine-making) industry
in the herbaceous habitats of valley bottoms as well as from cattle- grazing  practices in forested and riparian areas  at all elevations.









Black Swift is sensitive to climate  change.

Urban development, agriculture,  and pine  beetle infestations contribute to the loss of large, cavity-bearing trees  or snags  required for nesting or roosting, and can severely impact  populations
of several species such as Lewis’s
Woodpecker.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Conserving and Restoring Riparian Habitat for Lewis’s Woodpecker Although riparian areas  and other wetlands are limited  in distribution within arid regions, such as the southern interior of British Columbia, they are critically important for wildlife. Shorelines and riparian
areas,  as well as the species that rely on them,  face a wide variety
of pressures. Over the past  five years, the Partners in Flight regional
working group for British Columbia/Yukon supported partners of the Kettle River watershed riparian working group to map  riparian cottonwood habitat. Analysts overlaid  nest  record, land-ownership and threats data and prioritized habitats for three pilot restoration projects. A habitat scored higher  if it contained two or more  Lewis’s Woodpecker or Western Screech-Owl nests.  A parcel  of land also scored points  based on other criteria, including a willing landowner, other partner interests such as fish values or other species at risk, whether the property contributed to connectivity of riparian habitat, and whether identified threats warranted immediate action.  Partners prepared a restoration plan for each  of the three pilot projects based on species occurrence, scores, threats, and opportunities.

EASTERN BOREAL
REGION

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Eastern  Boreal Region  includes the Hudson Plains and the Boreal Softwood Shield from Ontario east  through Quebec to Newfoundland and Labrador. It is part of the area  covered by the Eastern  Habitat Joint  Venture. The region contains one  of the most extensive areas  of wetlands in the world, including coastal marshes and broad tidal flats, but also comprises vast tracks of coniferous forest.  It supports a high abundance of breeding birds, including 158 landbirds out of a total of 244 species, and is an important area  for Cape May Warbler, Rusty Blackbird, and Nelson’s Sparrow.

This large  and relatively remote area  is sparsely  populated, so the major  influences on forested habitats are still largely  natural forces such as fire, wind, and  insect outbreaks. Human impacts take the form of forestry and hydroelectric power.  Mining, renewable energy development, and the associated infrastructure to support them  are less important factors  at present, but their cumulative effects  could have substantial impacts on landbirds and their habitats in the future. Climate  change is also expected to have a growing influence  in the boreal zone  and likely will result in some degree of wetland drying and a greater risk of fires. As most  of this region is poorly served
by roads, it is outside the reach  of volunteer monitoring like the Breeding Bird Survey; therefore, information to assess the population status  of many bird species is inadequate.















Winter threats  may drive Rusty Blackbird declines.

CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Conserving a Boreal Icon, the  Canada  Warbler
The Canada Warbler  International Conservation Initiative (CWICI) is a public-private partnership to improve  the population status  of the Canada Warbler throughout its distribution. Launched in June
2013, CWICI brings  together the forest  industry,  representatives from Indigenous communities, academia, and government and non-government biologists in the Western Hemisphere. In 2015,
CWICI began developing a conservation action  plan for the breeding grounds. Although this species is declining throughout its range, declines appear to be most  severe in the eastern portion, much of which is within the eastern boreal.


Much of the Eastern Boreal Region remains  intact, enabling partners  to pursue  development and conservation in tandem to benefit Canada  Warbler and other  landbirds.
One  of the main recommendations is to develop and adopt beneficial management practices in the forestry, mining, renewable power,  and agriculture sectors to mitigate impacts on the shrubby understory preferred by the Canada Warbler. For example, ongoing efforts to encourage foresters to carry out practices that emulate natural  disturbance patterns will help create a mosaic  of habitats
for the Canada Warbler and other priority landbird species in the southern parts  of this region where  forestry is prominent and active.

LOWER GREAT LAKES/ ST. LAWRENCE PLAIN
REGION




BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Lower Great  Lakes/St. Lawrence  Plain Region,  the Bird Conservation Region  13 portion of the Eastern  Habitat Joint  Venture, includes the low-lying areas  south  of the Canadian Shield and north of Lakes Erie and Ontario as well as those along  the St. Lawrence River. Of the 288 species of birds that regularly occur in the region almost  two-thirds (187) are landbirds. These  southern parts of the provinces of Ontario and  Québec are the  most densely-populated regions of Canada, and most  of the old-growth deciduous and
mixed forests  that originally covered the area  have been converted to agricultural use. Urbanization is also causing habitat loss, especially along  lake and river shorelines, which provide critical
stopover habitat for migrating landbirds. Despite recent reforestation initiatives, remaining areas  of natural  habitat tend to be isolated and fragmented. Landbird  species in the region are also threatened by predation from domestic cats, collisions with buildings and vehicles, and climate  change, among other factors.  Aerial insectivores—birds that forage on the wing—have  experienced population declines of
up to 95% in this region in recent decades, which is more  than  any other bird group; however, the factors  contributing to this decrease remain  poorly understood.

Barn Swallow and other  aerial insectivores have declined at alarming rates.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Conserving Aerial Insectivore Habitat in the  Lower
Great  Lakes Region
Little is known about the underlying causes of the steep population declines of the formerly common Barn Swallow. Since 2013, Bird Studies Canada (BSC) has sent  information about Barn Swallow to landowners on whose  properties the birds were seen foraging or using possible nesting structures.
Receptive landowners agree to have studies of nests and the surrounding habitat undertaken on their land, to conserve important habitat, and to monitor breeding birds. If a barn must be torn down,  BSC
works with interested landowners to install alternative nesting structures prior to the birds’ return  the following spring.  One  study is looking  at how social cues influence  the birds’ use of alternative nesting structures. Wooden Barn Swallow decoys and audio equipment broadcasting Barn Swallow songs are installed at one  or two structures on each  site, and monitored throughout the breeding season. If successful, social cues could  be used to attract birds to alternative nesting structures.

PRAIRIE HABITAT
JOINT VENTURE





©Helen Trefry

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Prairie Habitat Joint  Venture is comprised of the Canadian portion of a single Bird Conservation Region  (BCR)—the Prairie Potholes (BCR 11), named for the millions of shallow wetlands scattered across  the landscape. This Joint  Venture extends from the foothills of Alberta’s Rocky Mountains to the Red River Valley in Manitoba, and from the U.S.-Canada border to the forested
habitats of the Boreal Taiga Plains BCR (6) in the north.  The climate is generally dry and grasslands are the dominant natural  habitat. Native grasslands are predominantly mixed-grass prairie, but fescue prairie occurs  in the west and north,  and tallgrass  prairie in parts  of Manitoba. A moister climate  in the northern and eastern extent of the region supports continuous tree  cover. The region supports 261 breeding bird species, including 188 landbirds.

Conversion of native upland habitats, like shortgrass prairie and sagebrush, to cropland, rangeland or other agricultural uses
has had the greatest impact  on landbird populations. The most severe population declines have  been observed for specialists of grasslands and  sagebrush, including Sprague’s Pipit, Chestnut- collared Longspur, McCown’s  Longspur, Baird’s Sparrow and Greater Sage-Grouse. Other important threats to prairie habitats and the landbirds dependent on them  include  overgrazing, oil and gas development, and invasive species. Climate  change is expected to result in drier, hotter summers and warmer,  wetter winters in the
region, but the full extent of the effects  on birds is difficult to predict.












Greater Sage-Grouse is endangered  in
Canada.























Large patches of native  grasslands
are critical for grassland  birds such as
Sprague’s Pipit.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Maintaining Wildlife  Habitat in the  Working Landscape
The South  of the Divide Conservation Action Program Inc. (SODCAP  Inc.) has been in place  since the fall of 2014. Its goal is to develop programs for habitat management that are economically viable for stakeholders while sustaining native prairie for species at risk and other wildlife. The initiative is a partnership between stakeholders from the agriculture, energy, and conservation sectors, and
municipal,  federal, and provincial governments working in the Milk River Watershed of southwestern Saskatchewan. One  of their most effective  and innovative  tools is “Results  Based  Agreements” that reward  producers for meeting habitat targets based on the habitat requirements of focal species like Sprague’s Pipit. The agreements are non-prescriptive, which allows the producer to decide whether the targets are feasible in a given year or not. Producers who meet results  for grass  height, sage-brush density, and litter cover receive  a payment for that year. This approach encourages producers to make management decisions that support species at risk on their land.

REGION

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Southern Shield and Maritimes  Region,  which is part of the Eastern  Habitat Joint  Venture, includes the areas  east  and west of Lake Superior in Ontario and the southern Laurentian area  of
Quebec, which correspond to Bird Conservation Region  (BCR) 12,
the Boreal Hardwood Transition,  in Canada. It also includes Quebec’s Appalachian region and Gaspé Peninsula, and the Maritime provinces, which make up the Canadian portion of BCR 14, the Atlantic Northern Forest.  A total of 329 species of birds regularly breed, overwinter, reside year-round or routinely  migrate through
the region, including 190 landbirds such as Watch List species like Black-billed  Cuckoo and Evening  Grosbeak. The region consists of both hardwood- and softwood-dominated forests  on poorly-drained soils. The rocky, mountainous terrain  is dotted with extensive plains, valleys, rivers, and small lakes, in which the dominant human  activity is logging. Though they provide critical bird habitat throughout
the region, wetlands are most  abundant in the Maritimes,  where
agriculture, fishing and aquaculture are also important industries.

Long-term management of forestry has resulted in habitat fragmentation, disturbance, and a scarcity of both large-diameter trees and snags with cavities. Acid precipitation and pesticide spraying in forests  reduce the availability of insect  prey. Agricultural intensification and residential and commercial development result in land conversion which has significant  impacts on birds and
their habitats. Waterfowl are the  only bird species group whose populations have  increased in this region since  the  1970s.










Black-billed  Cuckoo are declining.






















Bicknell’s Thrush in Quebec may benefit from regeneration of dense coniferous forest  after managed harvest.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Conserving Bicknell’s Thrush Habitat in Eastern Canada
The not-for-profit group QuébecOiseaux partnered with the
forestry company Domtar to produce a management plan for 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of land east  of Montreal along  the border with Maine. The area,  which is part of the Bicknell’s Thrush breeding range, is Forest  Stewardship Council certified,  which means that forests  must be well managed to provide environmental, social and economic benefits. The company agreed to postpone their logging operation until after QuébecOiseaux biologists conducted surveys to determine where  Bicknell’s Thrush occurred. A collaboratively developed harvest  plan for the mountain included both areas  to remain  untouched and areas  to be harvested in a manner that
would encourage regrowth of the dense, stunted coniferous forest preferred by Bicknell’s Thrush. The post-harvest landscape looked promising; however, future surveys will be needed to determine the optimal habitat and breeding success for Bicknell’s Thrush in these managed forests.

WESTERN BOREAL
JOINT VENTURE

BIRD CONSERVATION LANDSCAPE
The Western Boreal Region,  affiliated with the Prairie Habitat Joint Venture, is comprised of the Northwestern Interior Forest Bird Conservation Region  (BCR 4), and portions of the Boreal Taiga Plains BCR (6), Taiga Shield and Hudson Plains BCR (7), and Boreal Softwood Shield BCR (8) west of Ontario. A mix of boreal forests  dominates the landscape interspersed with lakes, ponds, marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. Taiga and alpine  tundra occur
in northwestern portions of the region, while peatlands overlay the granite bedrock of the Canadian Shield and coastal floodplains and marshlands typify the Hudson Plains. These  boreal habitats support
318 bird species, including 209 landbirds. Among  them  are Blackpoll Warbler, Boreal  Chickadee, and Alder Flycatcher, each  with steep population declines.

The pace and  extent of habitat change in the  Western Boreal
Forest, particularly in the south,  has grown rapidly with the expansion of both traditional industries such as forestry, oil and gas, and
newly emerging activities like hydraulic fracturing.  Habitat loss
and alteration in southern portions of BCR 6 stem  from agriculture and linear features such as roads, railways, power/utility lines, and pipelines. Climate  change is a significant  issue mainly in the north.

Despite these threats, opportunities for proactive conservation still exist to keep common species common and preserve important ecological features and processes.


Habitat fragmented by mixed use.





















Western Tanager  is tolerant  of open habitats  but are still predicted to decrease with further development and climate  change.
CONSERVATION IN ACTION
Using Models to Evaluate Landbird Population Objectives Land-use change models can assess the feasibility of regional population objectives. A team of University of Alberta/Boreal Avian Modeling Project  researchers modeled current  habitat conditions and three possible future scenarios over 30 years: continued land development (Business As Usual); protected areas  over 20% of the  study area (Protected Areas); and increased forest  fire burn rate from climate change (Climate Change). Regional  population objectives were not met for any of the four priority landbird species modeled. Specifically, populations of Black-throated Green Warbler, Boreal Chickadee, and Western Tanager—mature and old forest  species— were projected to decrease under all three scenarios. Significant increases were projected for White-throated Sparrow under all scenarios, but still fell short of the objective. The Protected Areas scenario resulted in higher  population sizes for three species while the Climate  Change scenario resulted in lower population sizes for
all species. This approach allows conservation planners to assess and revise regional objectives and on-the-ground actions.

PIF SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH


OVERVIEW OF PIF SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH
Partners in Flight (PIF) conservation planning and action  is guided by a biologically-driven process built on a foundation of scientific knowledge about birds and the threats they face (see descriptions in Pashley et al. 2000, Rich et al. 2004, and Alexander 2011). PIF follows a step-by-step planning approach and a logical process for setting objectives, working with partners to implement conservation actions, and evaluating progress toward these objectives. Our approach, originally described as the PIF “Flight Plan” (Pashley et al. 2000), formed the basis for the PIF North  American  Landbird  Conservation Plan (Rich et al. 2004), Saving Our Shared Birds: PIF
Tri-National  Vision for Landbird  Conservation (Berlanga  et al. 2010) and many other bird conservation planning efforts at multiple  scales.  PIF’s step-by-step approach, applied through a broad collaboration among avian scientists from universities,  agencies, and Non governmental organizations, includes:
•   Assess conservation vulnerability of all landbird species;
•   Identify species and habitats most  in need of conservation attention;
•   Set numerical population objectives for species of continental and regional importance;
•   Set habitat-based conservation objectives and identify conservation actions for priority species;
•   Identify suites  of focal species that are representative of desired habitat conditions;
•   Work with partners to implement strategies for meeting species and habitat objectives at continental and regional scales;
•   Evaluate  conservation outcomes using habitat measures, response of focal species, and priority species’
population trends; and
•   Revise conservation priorities,  objectives, and actions as new data and evaluation results  become available.

In the sections below,  we briefly describe the methodology employed in this 2016 Plan Revision, highlighting new data sources, refined  methods, and updated results  since Rich et al. (2004).

CONSERVATION VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Global Species Assessment
PIF assesses the conservation vulnerability of all native landbird species throughout their range and annual  cycle, based on biological criteria that evaluate distinct  components of vulnerability. The process has evolved over time (Hunter et al. 1993, Carter  et al. 2000, Panjabi et al. 2001, Panjabi et al. 2005, Panjabi et al. 2012) and has been refined  in response to external reviewers  (Beissinger  et al. 2000) and partner input.

The species assessment process uses data contained in the  PIF Species Assessment Database and is explained
in detail  in the PIF Handbook on Species Assessment (Panjabi et al. 2012). Each species is assigned global  scores for six factors,  assessing largely independent aspects of vulnerability at the range-wide scale: Population Size (PS), Breeding Distribution (BD), Non-breeding Distribution (ND), Threats  to Breeding (TB), Threats  to Non- breeding (TN), and Population Trend (PT) (see page 5 for descriptions). Each score  reflects  the degree of a species’ vulnerability due  to that factor, ranging from “1” (low vulnerability) to “5” (high vulnerability).

For each  species we calculated the Maximum Combined Score (Max CS), a single metric of a species’ relative vulnerability based on a combination of the individual factor scores (see Species Assessment Handbook). Max CS can range from 4 for a widespread, relatively secure species, to 20 for a species of the very highest concern. Global  scores for all landbirds have been updated for this 2016 Plan Revision, using the latest  data from the North  American  Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), other updated data sources, and extensive review by the PIF Science Committee. The updated global  scores are presented in Appendix A.

Species of Conservation Concern
The PIF Species Assessment uses a standardized and calibrated process to identify species and habitats most in need of conservation attention. A primary product of the assessment is the Watch List of species exhibiting the greatest vulnerability to regional extirpation or extinction. Here we present the fully updated PIF Watch List of Landbirds for the U.S. and Canada (see Table 1, pages 6-7), divided into categories that reflect levels of
vulnerability and PIF’s revised  population goals  for each  species (see sidebar on page 97). Identical  methodology was use to create the U.S Watch List for all birds (NABCI 2014) and most  recently  for all North  American  Birds (Canada, U.S., Mexico; NABCI 2016).
96  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
PIF also recognizes a list of Common Birds in Steep Decline  List, which represent species that do not exhibit overall levels of vulnerability warranting Watch List designation, but which are experiencing troubling declines throughout their range (see Figure 2, page
11). Paying attention to these still abundant species helps  PIF achieve its mission of Keeping Common Birds Common.
























Common Birds in Steep Decline,  such as Grasshopper
Sparrow,  are important because they  can consume an impressive amount of insects  in a single  day. These landbirds  help  maintain  healthy  ecosystems by providing services, including insect  control, pollination, and seed dispersal.
CONSERVATION URGENCY METRICS

SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN EXPLAINED
Watch List
All Watch List Species have a Maximum Combined Score (Max CS) > 14 OR Max CS = 13 with PT = 5.

Red Watch List – Highly Vulnerable and in
Urgent Need of Special  Attention
Species in this category are on the Watch List
AND have either:
Max CS > 16 OR
[Max CS = 16 AND (PT + Tmax) = 9 or 10].

“R” Yellow  Watch List – Range  Restricted and Small Populations - In Need of Constant Care Species in this category are on Watch List AND not on the Red List AND have either:
[PS + Dmax > PT + Tmax] OR
[(PS + Dmax = PT + Tmax) AND PT < 4].

“D” Yellow  Watch List – Steep Declines, Major
Threats
Species in this category are on Watch List AND
not on the Red List AND have either:
[PT + Tmax > PS + Dmax] OR
[(PT + Tmax = PS + Dmax) AND PT > 4].

Common Birds in Steep Decline
Species in this category are native species not on the Watch List but with a PT = 5 AND PS, BD and ND < 4.
Along with identifying  species on the Watch List, we provide additional information that highlights these species' conservation concern and a sense of urgency for action  (Table 1). In addition to direct  measures of population change derived from long-term monitoring data, we introduce in this 2016 Plan Revision the new concept of “population half-life,” based on models that project trends into the future to forecast rates  of future population change.

Population Change – We used population trends from the BBS or Christmas Bird Count  (CBC) to estimate the percentage population change for each  species from 1970-2014. Range-wide population change is presented for Watch List species in Table 1 (see “Loss” column) and for all species in Appendix A, while region-specific
population change is presented in the tables within Joint  Venture (JV) and Canadian Region  profiles (see “Long- term Change” column) beginning on page 36. For species without  reliable  BBS or CBC data, we used other sources of information, where  available  for approximately the same  time interval, to put species into population change categories such as “> 50%” or “15-50%” loss.

Because population change metrics  based on BBS data were available  for Bird Conservation Regions  (BCR) but not for Joint  Ventures or Canadian Regions,  we used existing  BCR-scale data to generate approximate values for long-term change and short-term trend at the JV scale. We calculated a weighted mean of each  metric across BCRs within a given JV or Region,  with weights proportional to a species’ % of population within the portion of each  BCR in a JV or Canadian Region.

PIF SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH


Population Half Life – Data from the BBS time series  of indices  of abundance summarized at the BCR-level were used to fit a multivariate state-space model for each  species, as described in Stanton et al (2016). This approach allows for estimation of the trend and year-to-year population variability while removing some of the residual variance  belonging to the observation process. With the characterization of the population variability and the most  recent trend observed over the last decade, a forecast is then  made that projects the population forward to predict how many years in the future until a population size that is half of the current  abundance is expected
to be observed—this value we define  as the Population Half-life for each  species. This prediction is based on the assumption that the population trends observed over the past  decade will continue. This approach also assumes that the year-to-year population variability, as observed over the past  four decades, is inherent to the species
and has not increased or decreased substantially with climate  change or other changes on the landscape.

Half-life for entire  species’ populations are presented in Table 1 and Appendix A. The number reported for a given species in a JV or Canadian Region  table (see pages 36-95) is specific to that region and represents the Half-life value from the BCR with the greatest % of population for that species within the JV or Region.

DETERMINING AREA IMPORTANCE
Regions  of highest importance for the conservation of each  Watch List species during  breeding and winter periods are identified in Table 1. BCRs of highest breeding-season importance for a species have either  > 25% of the breeding population OR > 5% of the breeding population AND a regional relative density  score  of 4 or 5. Relative density  is a score  reflecting the density  of a species within a given BCR relative to the species’ highest density  within any BCR (See  PIF Handbook on Species Assessment for details).

For migrant species in the winter season, we applied similar methodology to newly available  frequency data from  eBird. Regions  of highest importance across  all BCRs, Mexican biomes, and countries/regions further south, were those with area  importance (AI) scores of 4 or 5, based on eBird data for the months of January and February  (“winter”). Similar to relative density  described above, area  importance is a score  reflecting a species’ proportional occurrence on eBird check-lists  within a given region during  winter relative to the species’ highest relative occurrence on eBird check-lists  within any region during  winter.

Regional  area  importance value for Watch List and Common Birds in Steep Decline  species are also presented  in the JV and Canadian Region  tables in pages 36-95. For these tables, regional area  importance is reported as either  the % of breeding population or the winter area  importance score.  The % of breeding population for each JV and Canadian Region  was approximated using data from the  PIF Population Estimates Database by summing the % of population across  all appropriate state/province-by-BCR polygons matching a given JVs or Region’s boundary. In cases  where  a state/province-by-BCR polygon was substantially split between two JVs, we assigned the BBS routes within that polygon to the appropriate JV and calculated the resulting % of population for each JV.

POPULATION ESTIMATES
Population estimates for all landbird species were updated for the 2016 Plan Revision, with estimates of population size within the U.S. and Canada presented for all species in Appendix A. The general approach,
as well as specific details on the PIF method for estimating landbird population sizes, is described in the   PIF  Population Estimates Handbook (Blancher et al. 2007, 2013). The general approach includes building range- wide estimates based on average relative abundance across  BBS routes within state/province-by-BCR polygons. Updated population estimates were based on BBS data for the years 2005-2014.

For this 2016 Plan Revision, an additional step was implemented to incorporate variability in the BBS counts and uncertainty in the three adjustment factors  (time of day, detection distance, pair adjustment) for the BBS-based estimates. A Monte Carlo approach was used to propagate  uncertainty arising from each  component of the calculation through to the final population estimation by making 1,000 iterations of the calculation, randomly drawing  from the distribution of each  component. The result is a distribution of population size estimates for each species in each  geographic region, which can be subsequently described by standard statistical  metrics (e.g., mean, median, 95% calculation limits). The mean of the population size estimate distribution is used as the

98  Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
point  estimate for the current  population size for each  species.
The printed version of this 2016 Plan Revision presents the mean population estimates from the Monte Carlo process for those species adequately covered by BBS. The 95% calculation limits will be available  through the PIF Population Estimates Database, along  with more  details on the Monte Carlo approach. U.S./Canadian estimates for some species (as noted in Appendix A) are based on independent estimates from species-specific surveys or based on expert knowledge combined with estimates of the % of the total population within the two countries.

CONTINENTAL THREATS ASSESSMENT
To create the Continental Threat  Index presented on page 14, we assigned a score  of 3, 4, or 5 to one  or more  of the 12 threat categories for each  Watch List and Common Birds in Steep Decline  species. These  scores were based on the Threats  Breeding and Threats  Nonbreeding scores in the PIF Species Assessment Database as well as associated comments. For each  species with TB or TN scores of 3 (moderate threats), 4 (high threats), or 5 (severe  threats), we assigned equivalent scores to the threat categories primarily responsible for elevated TB or TN scores. The Index value for a given threat category was the sum of scores across  all Watch List and Common Birds in Steep Decline  species, reflecting both the number of species affected by that threat and the relative severity of that threat across  species.

USE OF FOCAL SPECIES FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION
PIF promotes the use of a focal species approach that supports habitat management planning; habitat needs of focal species can be used to formulate on-the-ground objectives and guide conservation implementation.

PIF focal species are: (1) representative of a range of desired future conditions for healthy  ecosystems; (2) cost-effective to monitor; and (3) responsive to management actions and therefore can be used to set and measure habitat-based conservation objectives for both at-risk and more  common species. Focusing on suites of species that are indicators of desired future conditions, and not subject to numerous regulations, offers an effective  approach to engaging partners in voluntary conservation actions. By managing for suites  of species representative of important habitat components, many other species and elements of biodiversity  also will be conserved. Focal species can help tie PIF population objectives to habitat objectives to recover and sustain diverse  landbird populations at BCR and JV scales.

Monitoring a suite of focal bird species with standardized protocols can be used to test  the effectiveness
of conservation actions. Such monitoring is an essential component of an adaptive management approach. Examples of the use of focal species include  setting regional population and habitat objectives for riparian habitat within the Central  Valley Joint  Venture in California, and regional planning efforts throughout the Pacific Coast  region.

RESEARCH AND MONITORING NEEDS
Over the years various PIF-related documents have been published identifying  research and/or monitoring needs that are required to enable the effective conservation of landbirds in North  America. These include  Donovan et al. (2002), Ruth et al. (2003), Dunn et al. (2005), Ruth and Rosenberg (2009), and Laurent and Pashley (2009). Key research and monitoring
needs associated with this 2016 Plan Revision are provided throughout the document in the relevant sections of text or PIF Recommended Action boxes.

BREEDING HABITAT AND WINTER GEOGRAPHY DEFINITIONS FOR U.S./CANADIAN  LANDBIRDS Primary breeding habitat and primary winter geography for all 448 landbirds in Canada and the U.S. are presented in Appendix A.

PRIMARY BREEDING HABITAT: The follow definitions were adapted from categories used in the  State  of North  America’s Birds Report  (NABCI 2016) and database (www.stateofthebirds.org). Colors reflect the Major Habitat category used in that report (e.g., Forests, Aridlands,  etc.).

Wetland generalist = uses a wide variety of freshwater wetlands, over a wide geographic area; birds may have a specific nesting requirement, but can nest  in a variety of situations that provide nesting substrate (e.g., trees, shorelines).

Freshwater marsh = permanent or semi-permanent freshwater wetlands with emergent aquatic vegetation
(cattails, etc.); often  embedded within other “parent” habitats; species often  widespread geographically.

Prairie wetland = ephemeral or seasonal wetlands, usually dominated by grasses (as opposed to cattails,  etc.);
primarily within Prairie biome of U.S. and Canada.

Coastal  saltmarsh = tidally influenced saltmarsh, primarily on Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.

Mangrove = mangrove swamps  from Florida and Mexico south. Arctic tundra  = tundra habitat in arctic region of Canada and Alaska. Alpine  tundra  = alpine  habitat on high elevation mountaintops.
Grassland  = native grassland, pasture, and agriculture that supports grassland birds.

Chaparral = unique shrub  community, primarily in coastal California and Baja, including coastal sage, but also similar shrub  habitats in interior Southwest.

Desert scrub = a broad range of desert communities, including Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, and
deserts of Mexico’s Central  Plateau.

Rocky  cliffs = a separate designation for certain  species that occur primarily in aridland regions but also in barren rocky areas  within forested mountains.

Boreal forest = “true” boreal forest  of Canada and Alaska, and also the boreal zone  (primarily spruce-fir) of high
mountains in the western and northeastern U.S.

Eastern forest = all forest  types  of eastern U.S. and southeastern Canada (below the boreal),  including northern hardwoods, oak-hickory, pine-oak, southern pine, and bottomland hardwood associations.

Western forest = all forest  types  of western U.S. and Canada (below the boreal)  and extending through high mountains south  into northwestern Mexico; includes Pacific Northwest rainforest, all western conifer, oak- dominated, and riparian forests,  pinyon-juniper, juniper-oak woodlands of Edward’s Plateau, and high-elevation conifer forests  of northwestern Mexico (above  pine-oak).

Mexican pine-oak forest = distinctive  pine-oak forests  of Mexican mountains, including similar forests  in
“sky island”  mountains from southeastern Arizona to western Texas, and extending south  in northern Central
America.

Tropical dry forest = broad array of deciduous and semi-deciduous forests,  including arid thorn  forest; primarily on Pacific slope from northwestern Mexico to northwestern Costa  Rica, but also including Tamaulipan “thornscrub” throughout Texas and other areas.

Forest  generalist = occurs  in roughly equal abundance in three or more  forest  types.

Habitat Generalist = occurs  in roughly equal abundance in three or more  major habitat types,  usually including forest  and non-forest categories.

WINTER GEOGRAPHIC REGION: The primary region within which a species spends the northern winter (i.e., stationary nonbreeding period);  based on regions identified at PIF V Workshop, 2013, in Snowbird, UT and modified and expanded to include  all migratory species. Regions  south  of the U.S. correspond with mapped regions in Figure 7 on page 23. Non-migratory species are designated as Resident.

Caribbean = islands of the West Indies and Caribbean Sea.

Central  and South American Highlands = subtropical and cloud  forest  zones  of mountain regions from Honduras south  through Central  America to the northern Andes  and other mountains of northern South America.

Chihuahuan Grasslands = distinctive  arid grassland region of northern Mexico and extreme southwestern U.S.

Gulf-Caribbean Lowlands = Atlantic slope region from northeastern Mexico to Panama (based on avifauna, potentially also including lowlands  of Panama from Canal Zone south,  and low areas  of northern Colombia north and west of Andes).

Mexican Highlands = pine-oak, cloud  forest,  and Mexican highland forest  zone  from northern Mexico through
Guatemala and Honduras to northern Nicaragua and El Salvador.

Pacific Lowlands = Pacific slope from northwestern Mexico to northwestern Costa  Rica, including inland
drainages (e.g., Baslas).

South American Lowlands = all lowland areas  east  and south  of the Andes,  including Amazonia,  Pantanal, dry forest  types,  and grasslands.

Southwestern Aridlands = aridland region of southwestern U.S., northwestern Mexico, and Mexican Plateau.

U.S./Canadian regions = for migratory species that winter primarily north  of Mexico (i.e., not Neotropical migrants),  we describe a broad region (e.g., Northern U.S./Canada) that indicates general winter distribution and does not correspond with any mapped biographic regions.

Widespread = occurs  in roughly equal abundance in three or more  geographic regions.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


We thank the many agencies and institutions that provided  support for all the 2016 Plan Revision authors,  with special appreciation to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Northeast Region  for their staff’s time.  This  2016 Plan Revision would not have happened without the continued dedication
of numerous individuals throughout our diverse network  of partners, and especially without the commitment and leadership on the Partners in Flight  (PIF) Council, PIF  Steering Committee, Regional Working Groups, and Bird  Conservation Committee of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.
We also deeply thank the Bird  Conservancy of the Rockies  for its long-time support of the Species Assessment Database, including the substantial staff time  necessary to maintain it. We give special recognition to John Sauer  at the USGS  Patuxent Research  Center for providing regular updates of results  from the North  American Breeding Bird  Survey (BBS), and for working to maintain the vital role that the BBS  plays in the PIF  Species Assessment process.


We thank the following  people for input and support through  the 2016 Plan Revision process: Brad Andres, Anne Bartuszevige, Susan Bonfield,  Mike  Brasher, Deanna Dixon,  Mike  Dunphy, Ali Duvall, Kristen Dybala, Chris Eberly,  Patricia Edwards, Sara Evans-Peters, Todd Fearer, Jane Fitzgerald, Jesús  Franco, Geoff Geupel, Dave Gordon, Scott Johnston, Ed Laurent, Keith McKnight, Charisa Morris, Jocelyn Neysmith, Clark Rushing, Tashs  Sargent, Sandra Scoggins, Dave Smith, Greg Soulliere, Pam  Toschik,  Dana Varner,  Bill Vermillion, Josh Vest, Barry Wilson, and Greg Yarris.

We appreciate  the generous  contributions of photos by many talented  photographers. Photos credited to “Cornell Lab” were provided  by the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. All photographs in the Plan are owned and copyrighted by the photographers, who are credited next to their image(s). The artwork  for the full life-cycle conservation figure on P. 23 was generously provided  by Misaki Ouchida.

Partners in Flight 2016 Landbird Conservation Plan Revision
“Partnerships allow us to spread our wings beyond our own nests.”


Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change


On the Release of The State of North America’s Birds Report, 2016








































Grassland birds, such as the Greater Prairie-Chicken, are declining faster than any other  group of North
American landbirds  and require immediate attention to maintain  these emblematic species.

“Besides our moral imperative to maintain the earth’s beauty and bounty for future generations to enjoy, it is important to view birds as accessible indicators of the health of our lands and waters….In short, healthy bird habitat makes for healthy human habitat.”


John W. Fitzpatrick, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, New York Times Op-ed, Aug. 29, 2014
