"To stand at the edge of the sea,  to sense the ebb andflow of the tides,  to feel the breath ofa mist moving over a great salt marsh,  to watch the flight ofshore birds that have swept up and down the surf lines
of the continents for untold thousands ofyears,  to see the running of the old eels and the young shad to the sea,  is to have knowledge of things that are as nearly eternal as any earthly life can be."

Business strategies differ from standard conservation plans by focusing  on a set of well-developed actions  that link
funding to specific, measurable conservation outcomes, rather  than  producing long lists of possible  actions,  some of which  may not be clearly defined. Typically, a conservation plan describes  the natural history of species, lists conservation threats and needs, and presents  a painstaking approach that applies objective  criteria  to determine high priority species. A business  strategy builds  on the scientific foundation of conservation plans by presenting strategic conservation solutions  as actionable investment opportunities.

A business  strategy emphasizes  three  additional aspects generally lacking  or minimally developed  in a conservation plan: prioritized actions,  funding, and outcomes. Prioritizing actions, or grouping actions  into tiers that rank their  urgency, shows interested parties, particularly potential funders,  that some actions  need to be implemented more quickly than others to maximize conservation opportunities and successes. Although costs associated  with implementing
actions are articulated in some conservation plans, the linkage  of funding to an explicit outcome goal is central  to a
business  strategy. This linkage  allows the success of conservation investments to be evaluated  based  on progress  toward measurable outcomes. Specific outcomes of conservation actions,  such as reduced mortality or increased productivity, are often difficult to predict, and some scientists are hesitant to predict such outcomes in the face of uncertainty. Yet
the best available information can generally be used to make an educated guess about how organisms will respond
to conservation actions. By clearly describing the assumptions of predictions, effectively carrying out informative monitoring systems, and objectively evaluating conservation success, a business  strategy  can be adapted over time to maximize  the benefits  of conservation investments in the face of uncertainty.

SUMMARY



The Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Conservation  Business Strategy is an unprecedented endeavor to implement conservation for shorebirds across an enormous geographic scale that involves numerous  federal, state, provincial, and local governments, conservation groups, universities, and individuals. The business strategy approach emphasizes the involvement of scientists, advocates, funders, and other practitioners all working together for prioritized  on-the• ground actions that move toward specific, measurable outcomes. In short,
this strategy presents the needs, actions, and individuals that will recover this remarkable suite of species.

The conservation needs of these species are best represented by the story of the Eskimo Curlew, once an abundant  species along the Atlantic coast and now presumably extinct as a result of market hunting and severe habitat loss across
its range. The flyway approach is crucial for these species whose range represents virtually the entirety of the globe, from the High Arctic to stopover sites in the mid-latitudes  to wintering areas in the southernmost lands of South America. With evidence of threats in all these far-flung areas, a full annual cycle approach is needed. Unless range-wide actions presented in this strategy are taken shorebird species will succumb to threats that are taking a daily toll on these iconic birds, the effects of which will reach an irreversible tipping point.

Through expert opinion, peer-reviewed and published information, and our best-educated  guesses, a list of priority focal, species and geographies has been identified and is used throughout this strategy. This list represents the species and geographies with the highest conservation needs and serves to represent other shorebirds that are in a less dire state. Focusing on the priority species should give us the best chance to recover all species of shorebirds (and many associated coastal birds) along the Atlantic Flyway.

We view this business strategy as the implementation of tactical conservation. Above all else, the strategy contains the most important  actions and associated costs, predicts measurable outcomes of those actions, and engages potential funders and other action-oriented organizations to ensure implementation. The goal of the strategy-and the motivation of its partners- is to recover species through a tactical process.

Overall business strategy goal:
The goal of this conservation  strategy is to create a long-term platform for stability and recovery of focal species identified. The cummulative imapct of the projects developed herein, will increase current shorebird population levels by
10-15 %, by 2020, at a cost of approximately $20 million per year.

Disclaimer:
The strategy contains estimates of costs and outcomes for projects that were developed using the best available information  and include predictions that are based on individual expertise and not necessarily on empirical data. Evaluation and assessment of these predictions is critical to ensure adequate tracking of progress.

The disappearance of the Eskimo Curlew exemplifies the enormous threat that humans have posed to shorebirds and their habitats over the last 150 years. Once tremendously  abundant, these birds were hunted to probable extinction in the United States during their north-  and south-bound migrations between Canadian tundra breeding sites and South American grassland wintering areas. Curlews were not alone. Almost every other shorebird species using the Atlantic Flyway was at one time hunted for their commercial value (e.g., restaurants, millinery trade) or for unregulated  sport. By the 1930s, many species were in serious decline. As the Eskimo Curlew declined toward extinction, many others like the American Golden• Plover and Buff-breasted Sandpiper came perilously close to oblivion before anyone recognized the need for shorebird conservation. Along the Atlantic Flyway, it wasn't just the migrants that were in peril. Locally-breeding species like American Oystercatcher and Willet were also hard hit. We had nearly eliminated an entire suite of species that represented the wildness of our coastlines.

Over the years the plight of these birds began to be recognized. Such recognition became poignant to many avid shorebird hunters, who helped spur the birth of a new conservation ethic and inspired protective laws that allowed populations  of most shorebirds to begin recovery. As a result of their call to action, we were given another chance to demonstrate  our capacity as stewards for these masters of migration and ambassadors of the special places where land and water meet.

Now, shorebirds are in trouble again. We must reinvigorate our stewardship responsibilities and take action to thwart renewed shorebird declines. Threats to shorebirds have become more diverse and widespread in recent decades and pose serious conservation challenges. The collapse of the Red Knot population, the sharp decline of Whimbrels in the mid• Atlantic, and a free-fall in numbers of Semipalmated Sandpipers wintering on the coast of South America have all taken place during only the last twenty years. Many other species are also in trouble. Cumulative stresses from human population expansion and commerce, particularly along coastlines, are limiting survival of shorebirds throughout the entire Atlantic Flyway.

But there is hope. Recent conservation gains, achieved for beach-nesting species (e.g., Piping Plover, American Oystercatcher, eastern Willet), show that we can reverse these downward spirals across the flyway. However, we must act fast and undertake  our own collaborative, far-reaching call to action. The Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Business Strategy identifies major threats and detailed steps needed to reverse shorebird declines and prevent a second, potentially far more extensive wave of shorebird extinctions.

Sandpiper.  William  Majoros
Each year shorebirds use habitats across a vast geography, undertaking some of the longest migrations of any animals on earth. Within the Atlantic Flyway, many shorebird species breed on the Canadian Arctic tundra and winter along the eastern shores of South America, stopping over at a number of critical migratory sites in between, particularly along the east coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Atlantic Flyway shorebirds are exposed to a diverse set ofhuman• induced threats across this network of sites. While the nature and severity of the threats may vary, each site plays a critical role in shorebird survival. Therefore, effective shorebird conservation requires a wide-ranging approach to identify and ameliorate threats that shorebirds face at multiple locations throughout the flyway. Such an approach must attempt to coordinate research, conservation,
and management  efforts of many groups across many political boundaries  and consolidate resources to undertake  efficient conservation activities. Only with a collaborative flyway-scale approach can we reverse the serious declines we are witnessing in many of our shorebird populations.

The Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Conservation  Business Strategy is a unique effort to initiate coordinated  conservation at a flyway scale that will reverse
Fifteen focal shorebird species were selected for this strategy to represent a wide array of regional ecologies and habitats throughout the Atlantic Flyway, taking into account conservation status. Species were also chosen to serve as representatives for other species that share similar conservation needs, making conservation planning more efficient and simplifying implementation. Focal species include taxa that:

1. are highly imperiled or of high concern;
2. represent important  habitat suites in the flyway; and
3. have existing conservation plans to make implementation more practical.

The focal species concept will guide shorebird recovery and management  efforts in the Atlantic Flyway to maintain high shorebird diversity and support declining or extant regional populations.

Specifically, the strategy identifies important activities to be implemented  at sites across the Atlantic Flyway by governmental and non-governmental partners representing all countries sharing flyway stewardship responsibilities. While
the strategy does not comprise a complete or final list of conservation activities, it details the most efficient and effective activities that can be undertaken to reverse Atlantic Flyway shorebird declines based on the best available collective knowledge of a diverse group of experts. Some critical conservation activities may be lacking, specifically within geographies of the Atlantic Flyway that were underrepresented in our group of experts, such as Latin America.

FOCAL  GEOGRA PHY:  CRITICAL  PLACES  IN  THE  ATLANTIC  FLYWAY                                                       IMPLEMENTING  TACTICAL  CONSERVATION

An effective conservation strategy requires  the identification of key areas where work should be focused. Focal geographies listed in this
strategy were identified  by overlaying all available distribution data for individual Focal Species with sites
in the Atlantic  Flyway previously identified  as important to these species ("Focal Sites"). Focal Sites were then aggregated  into larger regions  ("Focal Geographies"), covering the entire flyway, that shares broad  habitat features and conservation issues.

Focal Geographies are:


• Canadian Arctic & Subarctic
• Atlantic Canada  & Northeastern
U.S.
• Mid-Atlantic & Southeastern U.S.
• Caribbean
• Northern South America
• Southern South America

A comprehensive list of finer-scale
Focal Sites1  is provided in Appendix 1.

1The South American Focal Sites are only a first approximation and need further development by partners. Providing support for refining  South American Focal Areas is an important first step in implementation of the business  strategy.

Beginning in late 2011, shorebird conservationists began  conceptualizing ta strategy that meet the conservation needs of these far-ranging species throughout the geography of their  lifecycles. The first-ever flyway-scale strategy for Atlantic  Flyway shorebird conservation began by calling together North American shorebird scientists,  conservationists, and regulators to discuss needs for breeding, stopover, and wintering sites at a workshops held in 2012 and 2013. Participants emphasized implementation of conservation activities  at a project level. Details on the strategy to implement these conservation activities  are described below:

1. Priority Activities. The Atlantic  Flyway Shorebird Conservation Business Strategy is a collection  of priority activities  that need to take place to recover these species., This list of activities  represents "one-stop shopping" for potential
funders who want to have the greatest  effect on reversing declines  and recovering these decimated populations. The tables in the strategy list the highest  priorities for immediate implementation.

2. Evaluation. Implementation of even the highest  priorities can have uncertain outcomes. To reduce  this uncertainly and avoid further population declines,
we must  devote resources  to better  understanding the effects of implementing priority conservation activities and continuing to refine activities  so that will have the greatest benefits  .

3. In devising  this strategy, funding considerations have been as much  of a priority as determining focal species or actions. Many planning efforts do not seriously consider and prioritize the needs of potential funders. In future  drafts of this strategy, we hope that funders will be able to clearly articulate their  role in ensuring strategy successes. We will support strategic meetings  of funders to ensure  that the entirety  of the flyway is being  conserved.

4. Dedicated Participants. We must  ensure  active partnerships with engaged participants and leadership that continues well after the initial  strategy is developed  .  Adequate  implementation and evaluation depend on work by
a number of dedicated individuals. Evaluation is a critical  element  to assess and clarify outcomes,  determine if investment objectives were met, and revise objectives based  on the new information.
Goals: The goal of this conservation strategy is to create a long-term platform for stability and recovery of focal species identified.  The cummulative imapct of the
projects developed herein, will increase current shorebird population levels by 10-15 %, by 2020.


Funding: This goal will require approximately $20 million per year -- above currentfunding levels -- for at least 5 years.
As more projects are funded, additional monitoring will
be required to fill knowledge gaps and ensure actions are adapted and populations are
responding.

KEY STRATEGIES




















Banding American  Oystercatchers. Manomet Centerfor Conservation  Sciences
Seven key strategies were developed as core conservation efforts necessary to address limiting factors. Given limited resources, key strategies focus on actions that will have concrete and measurable outcomes on population  growth and sustainability. The seven key strategies are identified below, and examples of top tier projects are presented to the right.

Strategy 1. Reduce Threats to Populations
Take immediate action to reduce threats to shorebird populations  throughout the
Atlantic Flyway, including predation, recreational disturbance, and hunting.

Strategy 2. Manage and Protect Habitat
Protect shorebird habitat from threats such as development; effectively manage habitat to meet shorebird needs; and create more habitat to recover shorebird populations.

Strategy 3. Strengthen Conservation  Regulations
Engage and influence existing regulatory structures to ensure that strong and
up-to-date  regulations are in place for protecting shorebirds and their habitats at local, regional, and flyway scales.

Strategy 4. Develop Shorebird Conservation  Constituencies
Employ a concerted strategy to engage citizens, organizations, and governments in actions to abate threats facing shorebirds throughout the Atlantic Flyway.

Strategy 5. Engage Hemispheric Partners
Facilitate effective international partnerships; coordinate activities across multiple countries within the flyway; and ensure that resources are distributed where they are required to reduce shorebird declines.

Strategy 6. Assess and Monitor Population
Gain knowledge of Sshorebird populations, reproductivity, and survivorship to evaluate risk from human activities, and prioritize corresponding conservation actions. Measure the effects of ongoing actions to ensure they produce maximum conservation benefits relative to the resources invested, and strategically adapt activities and resource allocation as required.

Strategy 7. Reduce Gaps in Knowledge
Take immediate and proactive steps to evaluate, and address emergent, latent, and understudied threats to shorebird populations, before they have irreversible consequences.

HEMISPHERIC ENGAGEMENT:  A PHASED  APPROACH                                                                          THREATS



















Migratory birds know no boundaries.
To make this strategy truly hemispheric, engaging partners  in the Caribbean and South America  is imperative.
This conservation strategy was developed to target and alleviate regional threats to Atlantic Flyway shorebirds nesting on, wintering in, or migrating through
the eastern Canadian Provinces and the eastern coastal United States, with preliminary  efforts in the Caribbean Island and South American nations.

To fully address the conservation needs of Atlantic Flyway shorebirds migrating and wintering in the Caribbean and South America, the authors of this strategy recognize the crucial need to seek out and engage shorebird experts in the countries hosting these birds for the majority of the migratory year. Some of the threats to shorebirds, in the Caribbean and South America, will parallel those on North American coasts, but others will be regionally or hemispherically unique. We are interested in building an effective, collaborative, long-term conservation mechanism with Caribbean and South American partners in order to stem the declines and recover populations  of these shared migrant species.

This document  is the first of three phases of the Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Conservation  Business Strategy. The second and third phases will include direct engagement and participation  of Caribbean and South American partners to better define priority actions for Atlantic Flyway shorebirds throughout their lifecycles. Caribbean and South American partners have extensive expertise
and knowledge of important conservation  actions and programs. Engaging these partners will ensure that stopover and wintering sites are equally factored into flyway-scale recovery actions. Included in this strategy are actions to begin engaging with Caribbean And South American partners in 2013.
Shorebirds face numerous threats during their lifetimes. Natural threats, such as predators and severe weather, have been around for eons, and shorebirds have
co-evolved to persist with these pressures. However, human-induced threats, such as habitat destruction, recreational disturbance, unregulated hunting, and pollution are relatively new and can wreak havoc on shorebird populations. Shorebirds have not co-evolved with such threats, which produce levels of stress and mortality that can lead to rapid population  declines. Humans have also altered natural sources of mortality, producing additional strain on shorebirds. For example, human-introduced or inflated predator populations  and altered weather patterns, caused by human emissions of fossil fuels, have turned formerly sustainable causes of mortality into serious sources of population decline.

Activities presented in this strategy address the most serious human-induced threats known to affect shorebirds and shorebird habitats in the Atlantic Flyway. Unidentified and lesser understood threats can also greatly reduce shorebird populations. Therefore, the strategy includes activities aimed at filling critical gaps in knowledge so effective management  actions can be undertaken to alleviate such threats. Contributors  are confident that alleviating many of the threats detailed in the strategy will reverse shorebird declines in the Atlantic Flyway.

Many predator populations grow artificially large in association with the high numbers of
people living along the coast. Overabundant predators kill shorebird eggs, chicks, and adults in great numbers, leading to population declines. Human development of prime shorebird
nesting habitat forces shorebirds to nest in less desirable areas with more predators, further increasing depredation  risks. A successful conservation strategy
requires resources for supporting predator management  efforts
at important  nesting locations
and reliable techniques for measuring management success. New predator control methods must be developed to maximize effectiveness, and outreach efforts to educate the public and garner their support need to be
increased.

Human disturbance of shorebirds can decrease habitat quality and rates of survival. Recreational beach use, such
as off- road vehicle use, is of particular concern. An effective conservation  strategy must address human disturbance issues using a diverse set
of activities. Here we focus
on standardizing shorebird protection on public lands, enhancing and increasing enforcement of shorebird protection laws, establishing broad shorebird constituencies, and delivering focused public outreach and education.

Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Conservation  Strategy.....20
HABITAT  LOSS   & CHANGE

Focal Species
All

Purple Sandpiper and
Red-necked Phalarope
only in Eastern Canada and
Northeastern U.S.

Many land management practices along the U.S. Atlantic coast have long-term  impacts
on populations  of Atlantic Flyway shorebirds, eliminating beach and intertidal conditions that they require to persist. Widespread coastal engineering projects, including channel dredging, rock armoring, and beach rebuilding, affect survival of beach-nesting, migrant,
and wintering shorebirds. Other habitat management practices can also reduce critical shorebird food resources. This conservation  strategy proposes to work with state and federal agencies to: (1) develop and implement best practices for managing, restoring, enhancing, and creating shorebird habitat; and (2) strengthen and enforce regulatory protection of important shorebird sites. It also proposes that new management
and regulatory practices be made adaptive, to account for habitat modifications  resulting from climate change.

OBJECTIVES
1. Increase the amount  of protected  and  adequately  managed shorebird habitat  in focal areas  across  the flyway  by 50,000 acres.
2. Develop and  incorporate  adaptive  habitat  management models and  strategies for climate  change  scenarios for  each  region.
3. Achieve  no net loss  of shorebird habitat from  coastal  engineering and  development
projects.

We lack important  information about many shorebirds in the Atlantic Flyway, including the locations of critical habitats
and resources they require to persist throughout the annual cycle, how they move across their ranges, major threats they face and how to mitigate them, and the most effective ways
to measure population sizes and document  demographic trends. These knowledge gaps threaten our ability to efficiently allocate resources to shorebird conservation and impede us from evaluating conservation successes. Effective shorebird conservation requires broad collaboration to reduce knowledge gaps.

The enormous  task of reversing serious declines in shorebird populations  can feel daunting  at times. However, inspiration  can be gained through  stories of partners  "called to action.   -- examples of how the focused commitment of conservationists succeeded  in restoring  formerly declining populations.

Most shorebird  species in North  America began showing seriously declining trends  in 1970. Most of these species are still undergoing continued declines. But one species -- the American  Oystercatcher -- was the lucky recipient  of a highly focused partnership effort to restore its population. The following recovery example occurred  during  the late 1990's and following the publication  of the U.S. Shorebird Plan, which helped rally and focus management.

The American  Oystercatcher
The American  Oystercatcher  tells the story of a population responding directly to conservation action. This large, conspicuous  shorebird breeds along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Florida and along the Gulf Coast from Florida to
Mexico. The American  Oystercatcher population was on a downward  trend  that could have made the species a candidate  for listing as endangered or threatened.

The American  Oystercatcher Recovery Campaign  began in 2007 with the development  of the first-ever Business Plan for Conservation, a radical departure from other conservation plans that tied recovery of the population to a specific funding  level. More than twenty organizations  and agencies are now working together  to achieve the goals of the campaign. The campaign  is coordinated by
the Manomet  Center for Conservation Sciences and supported by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state agencies, and multiple private foundations and individuals.
