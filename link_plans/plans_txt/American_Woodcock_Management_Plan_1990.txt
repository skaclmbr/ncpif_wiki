AMERICAN  WOODCOCK
MANAGEMENT PLAN
























































U.S.  Department  of the Interior

INTRODUCTION

The American woodcock (Scolopax minor)  is  an avidly  sought  and  highly  regarded  game  bird  in  much of   eastern   North   America.      It   provides   considerable   recreational   opportunity,   and   therefore socioeconomic benefit.   In several states it is the most important migratory game  bird in terms of total harvest.   The  woodcock's welfare and  population status have been of concern to game  managers and sportsmen  for decades.

Purpose


Primarily due to habitat losses, woodcock are now less abundant than in recent decades.  Although the effect of hunting on woodcock populations is unknown, available data do not indicate that hunting has affected  regional  population  status.    Populations  continue  to decline in  some  parts  of  North  America, and recreational opportunities have been lost.   Public concern  over this loss stimulated action to address this situation,  and prompted  the development of a Woodcock Management  Plan (Plan)  by the U.S.  Fish and  Wildlife  Service.

The  purpose of this Plan is  to guide  the conservation  of woodcock in  the United  States.  It  describes ways  in  which  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS),  state  conservation  agencies,  other  public agencies,   and   private  organizations  can   work  cooperatively  in   addressing  problems,   developing management  programs,  and  otherwise  assuring the future  well-being of  woodcock.

Responsibilities


The  Department of the Interior has principal responsibility and authority for  managing migratory birds, including  woodcock.    This  authority was  established by treaty between the United  States and  Great Britain  (on  behalf  of  Canada).    The  Convention  for  the  Protection  of Migratory  Birds  has  been  the cornerstone  of cooperative  management  of migratory  birds  since  its  signing   in  1  916.     In  regard  to waterfowl,  cooperative arrangements have functioned well  because  of administrative mechanisms such as advisory  councils and  liaison  specialists.  These  mechanisms facilitate the exchange  of  views  and information  and foster  close  working relationships.   For  woodcock,  cooperation  has always existed  in spirit and in more tangible forms such  as survey work and periodic symposia for  the exchange of ideas and  information.   However,  effective continuous  cooperation  on  a  region-wide operational  basis  has been hampered by the lack of administrative  mechanisms such  as those that exist for  waterfowl.   This Plan was  designed to build  upon  existing  mechanisms to promote shared cooperation  and responsibility in  the management  of  woodcock.

Maintenance


Once  the  Plan  is  operational,  it  is  anticipated  that cooperative  management  will  become   easier  and perhaps  systematic.     Periodic   revision  of  the  Plan  will   be  necessary  as  situations,  priorities  and strategies  change.  The  FWS  and  cooperators  will  review and  update  the Plan every 5 years  .            Annual work   plans  will  be a  logical  consequence of the  Plan.   Due to the importance of  Eastern  Canada  for breeding woodcock,  the  Plan will  be reviewed and  updated  if  the Canadian  government  wishes  to join in  the conservation  measures outlined  here.

Principles


1.  Protection of woodcock populations and habitats requires cooperation and coordination of planning, research,  and  management activities  between  the  individual  states,  flyway councils,  and  the  United States  Government.
2.     Maintenance  and   enhancement  of  woodcock  populations  are  dependent  on  the   protection, restoration,  and  management  of habitat.

3.     Woodcock  populations  should    be  managed   by   identifiable   populations  where  these  can   be biologically justified  and  for  which management  regimes  are  feasible.

4.   Joint funding  by both  private  and governmental  organizations should  be considered as an approach to financing  high-priority  research  and  management  projects.

5.    Managed recreational  harvest of woodcock is  desirable and  consistent  with  its  conservation.

6.   Recreational hunting will  continue to be managed  under  existing regulatory processes in the United States.   States wishing liberalization of seasons,   bag  limits or other harvest strategies would  have to demonstrate  that  these  actions  will  not adversely  affect  the  resource.

These  principles  will   be  subject to  periodic public   review  to ensure they  are  consistent  with  sound management,  to evaluate  their environmental  impacts,  and  to  encourage public  participation.

Plan Goal


The  goal  of  this  Plan is to  increase  woodcock populations  to levels  consistent  with  the  demands   of people  who  use and enjoy them.  These  population levels would allow  recreational  hunting opportunities as well as provide benefits  to the thousands  of individuals interested  in observing this unusual  species in  its  preferred  habitats.

POPULATIONS


Woodcock occur  throughout the forested portions of eastern North America.   Their  range  is limited in boreal  Canada  by  the   distribution  of  earthworm  populations,  their  primary food   item;  existence  of permafrost;  and  unsuitable  forest cover.    The  northern  limit  extends  from   southern  Newfoundland through Quebec  and  Ontario  to eastern  Manitoba.   The  western  boundary of their range  is  marked  by the  prairie.    Breeding  densities  of woodcock  are  highest  in  Canada  and  the  northern  tier of states immediately adjacent to the  Canadian  border.   Woodcock breed  in  southern  states  at  low densities; however, the contribution, in terms of numbers of individuals, of these southern breeding areas to the continental  population  is unknown.

Woodcock annually migrate to southern wintering ranges, from  Virginia to southeast Texas.  Southward migration begins  in early September in the northernmost areas.   Peak concentrations occur  in locations where   migration  is  stalled  by  geographic  or  weather-related  obstacles,  which  temporarily  hinder continued  movement.   Winter distribution  of woodcock is widespread, with  highest densities occurring in  Louisiana.

Woodcock are  managed   on  a  regional  basis.   The  regions  are  divided   by the Appalachian  Mountains, and are referred to as the Eastern and Central Regions  (Fig.  1).  These  units are primarily administrative devices   that  roughly  approximate  patterns  of  woodcock  distribution.    Woodcock  exhibit  regional differences  in  migration  patterns  and  population  dynamics,  and  are therefore  referred  to as regional populations.   However,  individual  woodcock from  the Eastern  Region  can  occur  in  winter within  the Central  Region  and  vice  versa.

Status


The  U.S.  Fish and Wildlife  Service,  in cooperation  with the  Canadian  Wildlife  Service  (CWS)  and many state  and   provincial  governments,  annually   coordinates  a   survey   to  monitor  woodcock  breeding populations.    This   survey,known  as  the  Singing-ground  Survey,   determines  a  population  index   by counting  the  number   of  singing  males  in  the  spring   along  randomly  selected  routes  throughout the northern  breeding range  (Fig.  1  ).  The Singing-ground Survey  has indicated  an annual population decline of  1.8%  in the  Eastern  Region  since  1968,  while  the  Central  Region  population  index  has declined at the rate  of 0.8% over  the  same  period   (Fig.  2).   These  declines  indicate  total  decreases  of 36% in the
Eastern  population  and  19%  in  Central  population  over  the  past  23  years.

Survey coverage.




The Canadian  Wildlife Service  annually  estimates woodcock harvest and numbers of woodcock hunters by surveying purchasers of  Migratory  Game  Bird Hunting  Permits.   From this survey,  CWS determines the age and sex composition  of woodcock populations  as well  as harvest size,  distribution,  and hunter success.   Trends  in the  last  10  years  show  that fewer Canadian  hunters  are pursuing woodcock,  and hunter  success  there  has declined  as well.   No trend is apparent in the age and sex composition  of the Canadian  harvest.   In  the United  States,  FWS  monitors  woodcock hunter  success  and the  age and sex composition  of  the  harvest  by  a   non-random  sample  of  veteran   woodcock  hunters  and  waterfowl hunters  who  also  hunt  woodcock.      There  is  no apparent  trend in  age and  sex  composition  in  either U.S.  management  region.   The U.S.  Fish  and Wildlife  Service  has no accurate  measure  of total  harvest, harvest  rate,   or  annual   survival,   and  wing-collection  data  often  do  not  agree  with  results  of  state

harvest  surveys.   Nevertheless,  both  Eastern  and  Central  Region  hunt ers  have  experienced m uch  lower success   in    taking     woodcock    during   the   past   25   years.      A   com posite   estim ate   indicates   that appro xim ately   700,000  U.S.   woodcock  hunters  harvest appro xim ately   2  m illion  woodcock  annually.

A   com parison of  woodcock  and   waterfo wl   harvest  data   from  the   FW S  W aterfo wl   Harvest  Survey indicates  that during m ost years  woodcock are  am ong  the top  1   0  species  in  the  migratory  gam e  bird harvest in both  the  Atlantic  Flyway  and  the  M ississippi  Flyway.   These  estim ates  are  conservative,  and it   is   likely   that  if   better   woodcock   harvest  surveys  were   available,   the  relative   im portance   of  the woodcock  harvest  would  be  greater.

Woodcock hunters often join  conservation  organizations that promote  woodcock and  forest wildlife conservation  and  management.    An  unknown  number of Americans  derive pleasure from  watching woodcock throughout the  year.    Male  woodcock exhibit  spectacular  courtship  displays  on  spring evenings at sunset.   Viewing this ritual is a  popular spring pastime in many  areas.   Park managers and naturalists can reliably schedule nature  walks for  park visitors during spring evenings to take advantage of  these  displays.

Population  Objectives


The  overall   objective  of  management  agencies  is  to  accommodate  the  diverse  public  interests  in woodcock and  to assure that all citizens  who   wish to do  so  can  have  the opportunity to enjoy this resource..  Population declines should be stabilized  and population levels  increased  above  current levels.

HABITAT


The  loss  and  degradation  of habitat is the major woodcock  management problem in  North America. Impacts to woodcock habitat include decreases  in quantity and quality due to changing agricultural and forest practices; shifting land-ownership patterns; advancing natural plant succession; and urbanization and  industrialization.   Scientists hypothesize a  link between decreasing habitat quality from  advancing forest  succession and  declining woodcock  populations.   Reversing  this trend  is the  key  to restoring woodcock populations.

Status


Breeding  woodcock are dependent  on  early successional  habitats,  such  as brushy fields,  abandoned farmland,  and  small  forest openings.   These  areas  provide suitable  daytime  feeding locations,  nesting cover,  singing  grounds and night roosting  sites.   Good  woodcock habitat is widespread but also patchy in  distribution  and short-lived.   Land-use  inventories  have  revealed  that the  amount  of these preferred habitats  has declined   with  increasing  forest age,  increasing  urbanization,  subdivision of  larger  parcels, and changing land  management  objectives  and techniques.   Many  quality  breeding habitats  have  been lost  because  they are  more  easily  cleared  and  developed than mature  woodland.   Other  habitats  have been  lost  because   of changes   in  land  ownership.    Previously,   land  was  held  for  farming  and  timber harvesting,  while it  is  now subdivided into  small  residential  or  recreational  developments.    The  new owners often  do not  have  similar  management goals  as the  previous owners,  and are not  interested  in timber  harvesting   or  other  activities   that  create  forest  openings.     Most  woodcock  habitat   in  the northeast   and  northcentral  U.S.  is  owned by  private  citizens,  with  timber companies controlling  the next largest proportion,  and state and federal  agencies  holding  a small  percentage of the total land base.

During  migration,  woodcock  often  congregate  at  specific  locations  where  weather  and  geography combine to cause  high  population  densities  on  a  temporary basis.   This  phenomenon  is  primarily due to  the  woodcock's  habit  of  migrating  with  the  passage   of  a   weather  front to  take  advantage  of favorable winds  because   of its  inability to fly  long  distances.   The  best-known  concentration  areas during  fall  migration  are  Cape  May,  New   Jersey;  Cape  Charles,  Virginia;  and  Canaan  Valley,  West Virginia.   Eastern Shore  of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge provides some  protection to woodcock that become  concentrated  prior to crossing the mouth  of the  Chesapeake  Bay at Cape Charles.   The habitats at  Canaan  Valley,  West  Virginia  are  unprotected  and  under   increasing  development  pressure,  and existing cover is rapidly deteriorating.   The  Fish and  Wildlife Service  is   establishing a  national wildlife refuge  at  Cape  May  for  the  protection  of  woodcock  and  other  migratory  birds.    Specific,  discrete concentration areas have not been identified in the Central Region,  with the possible exceptions of some Mississippi  River  islands  and   bottomland  areas.   Nevertheless,   concentration  areas     important  to migrating  woodcock may  be located  with  further research.

While  much work has been accomplished in defining woodcock breeding  habitat requirements, less has been  done  to investigate their requirements during the  winter.   Woodcock are  known to concentrate along  the Coastal  Plain in the southern  A ti antic  states  and in bottomland  habitats  in Louisiana.   Coastal floodplain  areas consisting  of bottomland  hardwoods with  a  brush  and shrub understory  are  known to be important,  especially when   in  close  association  with  agricultural  fields.     Many  of these southern habitats  have  been  converted  to  pine  forests,  agricultural fields or  lost to  other  developments.   The effects of forest type conversion and large-scale clearing of forested wetlands on woodcock population levels are unknown or poorly understood.  There  are many  aspects of woodcock wintering ecology that remain  unknown.

Protection  and  Management


Habitat  management  promoting  early  successional  forest  types   has  been  shown  to  increase  local populations  of  breeding woodcock and other wildlife  species.   Additional  species  that benefit  from  this kind   of  habitat  management  include  ruffed  grouse,   white-tailed  deer,  snowshoe  hare,   numerous passerine bird species,  and many  other wildlife species.   Successful  management techniques have been demonstrated  on  public  lands  in  Maine,  Pennsylvania,  and  Michigan.   Private  and corporate  programs to manage  woodlands for woodcock and other early successional species  have  also  proven effective. Previous  woodcock habitat programs, both private and public,  have been focused on individual habitats; however, no large-scale initiative directed at widespread regional  habitat conditions has been attempted. While  it is unrealistic to expect government wildlife agencies  to acquire and manage  enough  woodcock habitat to  increase regional  breeding populations, it may  be possible  through cooperation with various private and corporate entities to demonstrate how large tracts of private land can be managed  to favor woodcock.   A  high  degree  of cooperation and  coordination between  all  agencies and  groups   will  be required to achieve  this  desired  result.

Protection of migration and wintering habitats is extremely important.  Without suitable habitat in these periods, woodcock experience poor  survival to the next breeding season.  Acquisition of key migration areas  may  be possible due  to  their discrete nature.   It is doubtful that adequate winter habitat can  be purchased by government agencies.  But agencies, private organizations, and individual citizens working together  through  coordinated  programs  can  benefit  woodcock  by  protecting  habitat.     Efforts  to coordinate  activities  among  these entities  should  have  the highest priority.

There  is  potential  for  increasing  woodcock habitat  on  lands owned  by  various government  entities. These  include lands owned, managed,  or licensed  by, or within the jurisdiction of, the FWS, U.S. Forest Service, Corps  of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Department of Defense (including Army and Navy bases),  Federal Aviation Administration,  and other federal,  state,  regional,  independent, and  local  governmental  entities.

Management  Priorities


Conservation  and  management of  woodcock habitat  is  the key to achieving  population  objectives.   A top   priority  is  the  implementation  of  a   program   to  help  commercial  timber  companies  incorporate woodcock habitat management in their timber management activities and to inform   private landowners about  potential  habitat  management opportunities  on  their lands.

Other  management  priorities  include  the  protection  and  enhancement  of  key  migration  areas  and wintering  habitats.   There  is need to investigate the  habitat requirements  of woodcock in key wintering areas such  as Louisiana and other Gulf  Coast states,  and along  the south  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain.   Once these requirements are more clearly understood, steps should  be taken to protect or otherwise conserve habitats  possessing the  desired  qualities.    Maintenance of these  habitats,  once  they are  identified,  will also  be important.













6
Habitat  Objectives


We  must  manage   and  protect  habitats  that  will   maintain  or  increase  woodcock  populations.    Our objective  is to achieve  this within  the next  1   5 years.   Action  plans  within  each  FWS  region  and  state should  be prepared,  to include specific  objectives that are to be attained  within  the  period.   These  plans should  contain  precise- descriptions  of  actions  to  achieve  the following  components:

1.           Increase woodcock breeding habitat in the northeast and northcentral U.S. by improving public  land  management practices for  woodcock and encouraging habitat  management on  private  lands.

2.           Protect  key  concentration  areas  that  are  important  during  migration  from   loss  and deterioration.   For  example,  Canaan  Valley,  West  Virginia is currently  unprotected  and is  threatened  with  loss to development  projects  as well  as habitat deterioration,  and only   limited   habitats  at  Cape   Charles,   Virginia    are  protected.     Efforts  to  protect threatened  habitats  at  Cape  May  have just  begun.

3.           Identify habitat requirements of woodcock wintering in southern areas,  determine the availability  of these habitats,  and  make  efforts  to protect  key  winter habitats.

4.           Promote  woodcock  habitat  management  on  available  state  and  federal  lands  where appropriate  and  consistent  with  respective  agency  land  management  goals.


RECOMMENDATIONS


Habitat


General  Recommendations


•          Funding  for this Plan must come from all segments of the affected community, including federal,  and  state  governments  as  well  as  private  organizations  and  individuals  who enjoy and  utilize  woodcock.

•             Financial  incentives  will   be  needed   to  induce  timber companies,  farmers  and  other landowners  to manage  their lands  for  the benefit  of woodcock,  whether  it  is  breeding or  wintering  habitat.

•             Many   landowners  are  currently  unaware  of  the  value  of  their  lands  as  woodcock habitat.      Programs   that  inform   and   educate   private   landowners   about   habitat management  techniques are  critical  to accomplishing  these habitat  goals.

•             To  preserve  and  maintain  certain  lands  of extraordinary  value  as  woodcock  habitat, conservation of these lands should   be assured through  acquisition or  other methods. Such lands  should  be managed  for  the benefit of woodcock.  Acquisition of such  lands should   be willing buyer-willing seller  transactions.

•             Public  agencies,  both land-management and regulatory entities that authorize land and water  uses,  should   be  encouraged  to  zone,  license,  or  otherwise  regulate  land  and water  uses  to prevent  the destruction  or degradation  of  woodcock habitats.

7
•             Public  agencies   that  own,  license,  or  otherwise  have  land-management jurisdiction should   be encouraged to  manage  their lands to  increase  woodcock productivity  and carrying capacity.

•             Natural   resource    agencies    should    provide    assistance   to  other   agencies,   private companies, and  individuals in planning   woodcock habitat management projects.    The Soil  Conservation  Service     should   be  encouraged  to  continue  including  woodcock habitat management guidelines in their landowner technical assistance programs.  The Cooperative Extension Service  should  be encouraged to include woodcock habitat management  in their landowner  education  and extension  programs.

•             Public  works  projects  and  federally-licensed  development  projects  should   avoid  the destruction and degradation of woodcock habitats.   However,  when  these actions will cause unavoidable adverse  effects to woodcock habitats, adequate mitigative measures should  be included  in  planning and development.

•             Financial   participation   by    private   conservation   organizations   is    critical   to   the implementation of the Plan.  Land acquisition and habitat management cost-sharing and demonstration  projects  are examples  of participation  that may  be necessary.

•             Joint ventures  should  be encouraged,  enabling  governments  and private  organizations to  cooperate  in  the  planning,   funding,  and  implementation  of  projects  designed   to preserve  or enhance  woodcock habitat.

Specific  Recommendations


1.           Both  public   and  private  organizations  in  the  United  States  should   be  encouraged  to cooperate   in   the  planning,   funding,   and   implementation   of   projects   to   improve woodcock habitat by promoting habitat management and preservation.  These programs should  include landowner educational packages,  newspaper and magazine articles, video presentations,  and  other  multi-media  forums.

2.           Teams   of  biologists   and   foresters  from   state   agencies   should    provide    technical assistance to timber and other land-holding companies and private individuals. Teams would  assist in refining timber management plans for  the benefit of early  successional wildlife, while  maintaining timber production.  Professional exchanges of biologists and foresters  between  companies  and  agencies   would   provide   company  personnel  with cross-training in wildlife habitat analysis  and management,  and would  foster improved communication  between  organizations.

3.           Integration  of wildlife habitat management techniques into timber management plans would   increase  timber  harvesting  costs;  however,  these  costs  could   be  offset  by access  fees,  providing landowners with tax credits for  management costs, and refining silvicultural   prescriptions   that   would    allow   for    increased   harvesting   efficiency. Consulting  foresters  and land  managers  should  be provided  with  silvicultural  guidelines for  woodcock habitat management.   A catalog of existing state and federal landowner programs incentives should  be prepared.  A program  to provide  private landowners with land  management incentives  should  be developed if existing  state  and federal  programs do  not meet  the need.





8
4.           Development of habitat management demonstration areas should  be encouraged at all levels of government, private industry, and other appropriate forums.  National and state wildlife  refuges,  wildlife  management  areas,  and  forests  should   consider developing areas where woodcock  habitat and  timber management can  be demonstrated.   These areas  will  prove  valuable  in encouraging landowners  to initiate  management  practices on their lands.

5.           Landowners should  be informed about the American Tree  Farm System.  This  program provides landowners with some technical assistance and provides them with recognition for  undertaking  management.   Programs of this type are effective  in promoting  wildlife and   timber  management  on   a    local   basis   because   adjacent   landowners  become interested  in participating  after  observing their  neighbors'  land  management  success. The  tree and  wildlife  "farms" also  act  as local  demonstration  areas.

6.           The  habitat requirements of woodcock  during the winter need to be investigated.  More information   is   needed    on   habitat   use   by   wintering   woodcock   and   on   habitat management techniques for  preferred  winter habitats.  Research into these areas should be encouraged.

7.           Protection of key staging or migration  concentration areas is needed,  especially at Cape
May,  New  Jersey; Canaan  Valley,  West  Virginia;  and  Cape  Charles,  Virginia.

8.           There  should   be a  periodic inventory and continued monitoring of woodcock habitat in North America in cooperation with states and private conservation organizations. Understanding  the  relationship  between  woodcock populations  and  the  amount  and quality   of   habitat   is   important   in   adjusting   habitat   and   population   objectives. Large-scale  land-use  inventories  can  be made  utilizing  satellite  technologies.

Population  Management


General  Recommendations


•             Woodcock  harvests  should   be  managed   through  the  existing   regulatory  processes.
Harvest regulations should  be promulgated so that harvest level is commensurate with population  status.    Bag limits  and  season  lengths  have traditionally  been  stabilized  for long periods of time.   This  should  continue as long as populations are above  minimum levels.

•             Woodcock population monitoring should  continue via the cooperative North American Woodcock   Singing-ground   Survey,   and   the  Woodcock   Wing-Collection   Survey. Improved  measures of harvest are needed.   Information  exchange between  Canada  and the United  States  should  be continued.

Specific  recommendations


1.           Harvest  regulations  should   be  handled   through  the  existing  regulatory  process.    A formalized system of technical consultation with the states is being  established through the Atlantic and  Mississippi  Flyway Councils.    These  Councils should  continue these mechanisms   to   provide  technical   review   of   woodcock  information   and   provide regulatory  assistance.


9
2.           Harvest management strategies should  continue to be based  on  a  regional population basis as long as biological information provides adequate justification for  separate management objectives.   If future investigation indicates significant shifts in winter or migrational distribution, or harvest derivation, appropriate administrative action should implemented.

3.           Better  estimates  of  total  woodcock  harvest  are  needed.     A   program   that  allows estimation of hunter numbers  and total harvest annually  should  be developed and implemented.

4.           Research  on the effects of hunting mortality on woodcock populations at both local and regional  levels  is   needed   because   of  concerns  about  the  impacts  of  harvests  on declining breeding   populations.

5.            Breeding  population  surveys   should   be  continued   in  the  current  cooperative  effort.
Further efforts to  refine,  improve,  and  validate the  Singing-ground  Survey   should   be continued.

6.           A  coordinated  effort  to  band   woodcock  prior   to  the  hunting  season   is  needed   to determine harvest rates, define harvest derivation,  measure  sex and age differences in survival, and evaluate effects of regulations on harvest.  The cost of banding  adequate preseason  samples  of woodcock may be prohibitive, so the cost-effectiveness of normal banding,  reward  banding,    radio  telemetry,  and  other  marking   techniques  must  be examined,  and the feasibility  of such  efforts  determined.



IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE WOODCOCK  MANAGEMENT PLAN


The  Plan is  a  broad  policy  framework that describes the overall  scope  of requirements for  management of  woodcock  in  the  United  States.    To  implement  this  important  Plan,  the  FWS  and  states  should establish regional,   and  state plans  that step-down national objectives to the operational  level.   These plans  should  include  realistic  cost  estimates.

1   .                          FWS  Regional  Woodcock   Management  Plans  should   outline  recommendations  for achieving national Woodcock  Management Plan objectives at the regional office level. These  recommendations should  delineate the responsibilities of the regional offices and how the  operational  program   should   be conducted.    Federally-coordinated  programs should  be identified, and detailed descriptions of on-going and future management and research  directions  should  be included.

2.           State Action  Plans  should  further scale-down the national  Plan to the state  level  with specific  programs  outlined  and  should   be the  vehicle  for  practical  implementation  of general strategies.   These plans require  specific details of cooperative efforts and implementation  schedules.

3.           Joint   Venture    Projects   should    be   implemented   through   negotiated    agreements.
Planning,   funding,   implementation   and   evaluation   measures    should    be   integral components of each  plan  or  project  proposal.   Specific details  of the  responsibilities, obligations,   and   contributions   of  each   agency   or   organization   should    be  clearly presented.     Each   project  proposal   should   be  forwarded  to  the  appropriate   Flyway

technical committee  for  its  review and  recommendation.
4.            Initial  Implementing  Actions  should  progress  according  to the  following schedule: (a)          The   Atlantic   and   Mississippi   Flyway   Councils  should   reaffirm   and
continue   formal   mechanisms  to   provide    woodcock   technical  and regulatory  assistance.

(b)          The  U.S.D.A.  Forest Service,  Ruffed Grouse  Society, and  FWS should hold  initial discussions under their new Memorandum of Understanding during   1991.

(c)          States  should   establish  teams  of  biologists  and  foresters  to  assist landowners  in  habitat  management  planning   during    1  991 .              States should  develop  action  plans  implementing this Plan by the end of 1992.

(d)          Joint venture action groups  should  be established to pursue  individual projects,   when    the   need   for   a    specific   project   is   identified   and forwarded  to the respective  Flyway  Council.

(e)         FWS Regional Plans should be developed  by spring  1992, and initial implementation  by the end  of  1993.
