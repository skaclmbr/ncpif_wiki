ACTION PLAN FOR NORTH AMERICA’S BIRDS




Reversing  the bird population decline will require concerted action  by individuals, governments, and  the private  sector. We can begin by implementing these priorities, drawn  from strategies produced by leading bird groups
and  partnerships.*



Overall Actions
•     Strengthen bird conservation objectives in public land and water management decisions, and increase federal bird conservation incentives for private lands.
•     Implement a sustainable net-gain policy for all high-quality bird habitat (for example, designated Critical Habitat and Important Bird Areas), and restore natural disturbance and water flows to key landscapes.
•     Preserve and maintain the quality of bird habitat in protected areas and across large landscapes, and develop/ enhance restoration projects across birds’ life-cycles and along flyways.
•     Restore and expand full regulatory protection and funding for migratory and Endangered birds.
•     Increase support for migratory bird habitat conservation on wintering grounds outside the U.S. and throughout the birds’ life-cycles.

Grasslands, Croplands,  and Rangelands
•     Halt conversion of native prairies and other grasslands.
•     Increase incentives for bird conservation programs in agricultural areas.
•     Reduce the overall use of pesticides and herbicides in croplands, and prohibit pesticides that cause significant harm to birds, insects, ecosystems, or human health.
•     Expand bird conservation programs to maintain and improve grassland habitat quality for birds in rangeland landscapes, both on breeding grounds in the U.S. and on wintering grounds.

Forests and Shrublands
•     Protect, maintain, restore, and sustainably manage forests that birds, including many that are Endangered, depend on for survival and recovery.
•     Reduce loss and fragmentation of forest habitats in breeding and nonbreeding areas.
•     Manage forests for greater structural diversity and a more natural species composition.
•     Adapt fire-management policies to better support natural forest and shrubland conditions.

Arid Lands
•     Manage fire regimes, grazing, suburban and other infrastructure, disturbance, water extraction, and invasive species (such as cheatgrass) to benefit birds.
•     Restore southwestern riparian areas to benefit
Endangered bird species.
•     Protect/restore important bird habitat such as sagebrush.

Wetlands
•     Protect and enhance high-quality wetland habitats in breeding and nonbreeding areas.
•     Protect and restore tidal flats and coastal salt marshes, and facilitate the migration of marshes inland through climate adaptation planning.
•     Continue to manage hunting at sustainable levels and continue to support waterfowl restoration efforts.
•     Protect vital surface water sources, especially in agricultural, riparian, and arid land habitats, from disruption, water extraction, and pollution.

Marine and Coastal  Areas
•     Manage forage fish sustainably and foster international action to reduce seabird bycatch in fisheries.
•     Reduce plastic and other pollution.
•     Keep offshore wind power out of high bird-use areas.
•     Protect seabird colonies and beach-nesting birds from disturbance and invasive predators; manage recreational impacts to coastal habitats.

Populated Areas and Infrastructure
•     Preserve and restore green space, expand urban forests, and use native plants in landscaping.
•     Keep cats from roaming, including both pet and feral cats.
•     Reduce bird collisions with building windows and other structures; for example, by incorporating LEED bird collision standards in building design and ensuring proper design and siting of infrastructure such as communications towers and wind turbines.
•     Reduce light pollution and turn off lights during migration to reduce collisions and other impacts.
•     Encourage infrastructure development that incorporates the best scientific data, public involvement, and mitiga- tion to minimize impacts to birds.

Climate Change
•     Reduce carbon emissions by eliminating fossil fuel development in critical habitats for at-risk birds.
•     Promote distributed solar, energy efficiency, and forest conservation as bird-friendly climate solutions.
•     Develop resiliency and adaptation programs to help mitigate the threat of climate change to birds.
•     Determine what can be done to lessen climate impacts on birds of the Arctic and marine islands.
•     Ensure climate mitigation measures do not harm birds.

Invasive Species
•     Implement invasive species management policies and adaptation programs on federal lands, and encourage similar action through education and incentives on state and private lands.
•     Establish havens free of invasive predators to enable bird populations to successfully breed and recover.

Science and Partnerships
•     Support the science needed to pinpoint and monitor the most critical sites and habitats in need of conservation to support birds, address the threats that are limiting bird populations, and inform management decisions.
•     Support research and development of glass and other products that reduce bird mortality caused by collisions and other factors.
•     Encourage citizen and youth engagement through science, outreach, and bird-friendly consumer choices (such as bird-friendly product certifications) to build a larger and more diverse constituency for birds.
•     Foster cross-organizational collaboration and engage the public and private sectors in conservation efforts.

* These  bird conservation priorities  are summarized and  drawn  from bird conservation plans  and  strategies produced by leading bird groups and  partnerships, including:  American  Bird Conservancy, the National Audubon Society,  the Association of Fish and  Wildlife Agencies, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the North  American  Bird Conservation Initiative, the North  American  Waterbird Conservation Plan, the North  American  Waterfowl  Management Plan, Partners in Flight, the Smithsonian Migratory  Bird Center, and  the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Partnership Council.
Each of these groups has produced detailed implementation plans  for different groups of birds and  bird conservation programs, and  identified specific actions to help  restore bird populations. Many are supported by or include  the involvement of the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service.
