American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The American black duck (Anas rubripes) was selected as a Focal Species due to its conser- vation need, representation of salt-marsh  and boreal species needs, and high level of current program  eﬀort and existing partnerships.  The black duck population  experienced a severe decline of >50% between the  1950s and 1990s.  Today,  the  black duck population  appears stable  but  below desired abundance.   Monitoring  data  including  spring abundance,  winter abundance  and productivity paint a mixed picture  of the stability  and sustainability of the population.  Researchers and managers have not reached consensus regarding current limiting factors.
Major threats to the black duck include, but are  not limited to:


• Loss and degradation  of boreal forest (i.e., breeding grounds)  due to economic devel- opment including hydro-electric,  mining, timber,  and agricultural  activities.

•  Loss and degradation  of wintering grounds, particularly coastal salt marsh due to urban expansion, pollution,  recreational  activities,  and sea-level rise.

• Predicted  changes  due  to  climate  change,  including  shifts  in temperature and  pre- cipitation  patterns and  phenology that  will exacerbate  current limiting  factors  and potentially  expose black ducks to novel limiting factors such as diseases.

Priority conservation and management actions include:


•  Development of a revised breeding population  goal based on the best available science.


• Development of harvest  and habitat adaptive  management frameworks to guide deci- sions and reduce key uncertainties.

•  Improvement of monitoring programs designed to provide estimates of seasonal survival and productivity.

• Development of monitoring  programs  to estimate  energetic carrying capacity  on win- tering grounds.

INTRODUCTION 



The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)  Division of Migratory  Bird Management (DMBM) initiated the Focal Species Program (FSP) in 2004. The FSP was developed in direct response to a recommendation from the Oﬃce of Management and Budget  to develop new, stronger  performance  measures  to evaluate  program success.  The  DMBM proposed  to the  Oﬃce of Management and  Budget  to use the  FSP  to systematically identify  and  implement management activities  to  improve  the  status of select  migratory bird  species and demonstrate the  depth  and  breadth of management challenges faced by the  USFWS  and  its partners (U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service 2007).  Species that met  ≥ 1 of the  following criteria  were included  in the  FSP:
1)  high  conservation need,  2)  representative of a  broader  group  of species  sharing  the  same  or  similar

conservation needs,  3) high level of current  program  effort,  4) potential to  stimulate partnerships, and  5) high likelihood that factors  affecting status can realistically  be addressed.  Based on these criteria  and after broad  consultation the  DMBM identified  139 focal species to emphasize  in the  short  term  (U.S.  Fish  and Wildlife Service 2007).

The  American  black duck  (Anas  rubripes;  hereafter  black duck)  was selected  as a Focal  Species due to its conservation need, representation of salt-marsh and boreal species needs, and high level of current program effort and existing partnerships. The black duck population experienced  a severe decline of ≥ 50% resulting in a variety  of management  responses  by  Federal,  Provincial  and  State  conservation agencies  in Canada and  the  U.S. The  most  concerted  management response  was the  establishment of the  Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture  (ACJV), Eastern Habitat Joint Venture  (EHJV), and  Black  Duck  Joint Venture  (BDJV) under the  North  American  Waterfowl  Management Plan  (NAWMP). The  BDJV  is an  international partnership designed to coordinate cooperative  monitoring, research,  and communications programs  to ensure the future sustainability of black ducks and other  waterfowl  species in eastern  North  America.

The  goal of this  Action  Plan  is to  identify  the  research  and  management actions  necessary  to  ensure  the future  sustainability of the black duck population. The objectives  of this Action Plan  are:


1.  Review the natural history  and population status of the black duck;

2.  Identify  and review potential current and future  limiting  factors  (i.e., conservation threats);

3.  Describe  priority  information, research,  conservation, and  management  needs to improve  the  status of the black duck;

4.  Describe  potential methods  for evaluating the  success of management  actions  taken  to improve  the status of the black duck.


The target audiences of this Action Plan are the DMBM, USFWS National  Wildlife Refuge System (Regions

This  Action  Plan  will be updated periodically  to  reﬂect  the  most  current information related  to black duck science, management, and conservation threats.




POPULATION STATUS



Historically  the black duck was the most abundant dabbling  duck species in eastern  North  America (Fig.  1). The black duck population experienced  a drastic  (>50%) and long-term  decline between the 1950s and1990s (Fig.   2).   Researchers  and  managers  proposed  several  hypotheses  to  explain  the  historic  decline  of black ducks  including  over-harvest, competition and  hybridization with  mallards  (Anas  platyrhynchos), decrease in quality  and  quantity of wintering  and  breeding  habitat, and  environmental contaminants (Conroy  et al.
1989, Rusch  et  al.   1989, Longcore et  al.   2000a,b,  Merendino  et  al.   1993, Nudds  et  al.   1996, Conroy  et al.   2002, McAuley  et  al.   2004, Zimpfer  and  Conroy  2006).   Research  into  each  of these  hypotheses  has provided  valuable  insight  into  black  duck  ecology and  management.  However,  the  black  duck  community has not reached  consensus regarding  the cause of the population decline or current limiting factors.  Further, the  population remains  below the  North  American  Waterfowl  Management Plan  (NAWMP) continental population goal and  has  been  identified  as  a  Species  of Greatest  Conservation Need  by  23 states  in  the Mississippi  and  Atlantic Flyways  (Table  1).  Finally,  indices of abundance and  productivity paint a mixed picture  of population growth,  making  the  future  status and  sustainability of the  black  duck  population uncertain.

Based on Mid-Winter Inventory (MWI)  data  the average finite growth rate  between 1990 and 2010 was 0.99 (±0.142 S.D.; Fig.  2).  However, the trend  differed between  the Atlantic Flyway  ( = 1.0, ±0.1421 S.D.) and the Mississippi Flyway  ( = 0.99, ±0.277 S.D.; Fig.  2).  Similarly,  a recent analysis  of Christmas Bird Count (CBC)  data  suggested  regional variation in population trends  of black ducks (Link et al.  2006).  The  CBC provides data  over a larger portion  of black duck winter  range than  the MWI and indicates  that black ducks are  declining  in the  southern and  central  portion  of wintering  range,  but  populations in the  northeastern range are stable  (Link et al.  2006).

Estimates of the  breeding  population from 1990–2010 suggest  the  black duck population is stable  (Fig.  3). The  mean  finite growth  rate  between  1990 and  2010 based  on the  integrated breeding  population estimate

was 1.01 (±0.095 S.D.).   However,  this  estimate  only applies  to  that portion  of the  black  duck  breeding population covered by the initial  surveys and may not reﬂect the overall population growth  rate.  Estimates of black duck wintering  and breeding populations in 2010 were 223,472 and 439,300, respectively.  In contrast to these  population indices,  estimates  of age ratios  based  on band  return and  hunter survey  data  indicate black duck productivity declined drastically between 1997 and 2007 (Fig.  4).

Though  questions  still remain about  the cause(s) of the population decline between the 1950s and 1990s, the factors that caused the decline may not be the same as those currently limiting black duck population growth and  recovery.   Identifying  and  understanding current limiting  factors  is critical  to black  duck  management and meeting the goals of the DMBM. Further, emerging issues including global climate change and increasing human  activities  will present important challenges to the future  of black duck conservation.

NATURAL HISTORY



Taxonomy


The  black  duck  is closely related  to  other  monomorphic  Anas  species in North  America  and  the  sexually dimorphic  mallard  (Table  2).  The  black duck and  mottled duck (A.  fulvigula) were considered  one species (A.  obscura)  commonly  known  as dusky  duck  until  1874 (Longcore  et  al.   2000b).   After  1874, the  black duck was known as A. obscura  but  the  scientific name  was changed  to A. rubripes  in 1908 (Longcore  et al.
2000b).  The name A. o.  rubripes  (Brewster  1902) was applied to describe a subspecies breeding in the north and  west from the  subspecies  A. r.   tristis  (Brewster  1909) breeding  in the  south  and  east.   However,  the subspecies  were determined not to be valid because  the  morphometric and  color differences were related  to age and sex rather than  genetics (Longcore  et al.  2000b).

Debate continues  as to whether  the black duck should be considered a subspecies of the mallard  or a separate

species.  Some researchers  consider the  mallard  to be closest to the  ancestral form (Johnsgard 1961) and  to represent a super-species.  Genetic research indicates  an exceptionally  close evolutionary relationship between the  two species and  that the  black  duck  only recently  diverged  from the  mallard  (Patton and  Avise 1986, Avise et al.  1990). The low genetic variation between black duck and mallards  has led some to conclude the black duck should not have species or even subspecies designation  (Ankney  et al.  1986).

It is diﬃcult  to theorize  the ancestral form (and  thus  the entire  mallard  group)  was sexually dimorphic  and some populations lost  this  condition  (Palmer 1976).  Recent  genetic  research  on the  genus  Anas  suggests the  mallard,  black  duck,  mottled duck  and  Mexican  duck  evolved from a common  monochromatic species with  a  holarctic  distribution.   The  North  American  black  ducks  (i.e.,  A.  rubripes,   A.  fulvigula,  and  A. diazi)  were  sexually  isolated  in  what  is now  southwestern and  southeastern U.S.,  and  maritime  Canada from the Eurasian stock due to glaciations  (Spencer  1979). Subsequently, the Eurasian stock (i.e., mallard) evolved  sexual  dimorphism  and  re-invaded  North  American.    Eventually the  sexually  dimorphic  mallard hybridized   with  the  North  American  black  ducks  (i.e.,  A.  rubripes,   A.  fulvigula,  A.  diazi)  creating  the genetic  patterns now observed  across species (Spencer  1979, Johnson  and  Sorenson  1999).  Spencer  (1979) concluded  the only tenable  hypothesis  is that the original North  American  black duck/mallard ancestor  was

sexually monomorphic  because it is diﬃcult  to envision the necessary sexual isolation  and selective pressure that subsequently lead to the evolutionary loss of sexual dimorphism.



Life History


Historically,  breeding black ducks occurred from North  Carolina  to Labrador, northern Quebec and northern Ontario  (Fig.  1). However, the number of breeding black ducks in the U.S. and Ontario  has declined markedly over the past  3 decades (Krementz et al.  1991). Black ducks reach sexual maturity in their  first spring after hatching and  form  pair  bonds  on the  wintering  grounds.   Nesting  occurs  from  March  in North  Carolina, Virginia  and  Maryland to mid-May  in Labrador and  northern Quebec.   Nests  are built  by the  female and consist of a bowl lined with vegetative  material  and filled with down from the female (Allen 1893, Longcore et al.  2000b; Fig.  5).  Females will re-use old nests or nests of other  species (Longcore et al.  2000b).  Nests can be located  in a wide range of habitat types including  wooded uplands,  agricultural fields and margins,  peat bogs, and tidal  marsh  (Reed 1970, Maisonneuve  et al.  2000). Mean clutch  size ranges from 8.9—10.4 and is typically larger  in the  northern compared  to the  southern portion  of the  breeding  range  (Stotts and  Davis
1960, Coulter and Miller 1968, Reed 1970, Belanger et al.1998, Petrie  et al. 2000). Females will lay additional eggs or re-nest if eggs or clutch are lost early in the nesting cycle. Incubation period is approximately 27 days



USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    16

(Stotts and Davis 1960, Reed 1970). Ducklings are precocial and nidifugous and leave the nest within 24—27 hours  (Allen 1893, Longcore et al.  2000b).  Nest success varies annually  and  by habitat type, but  averages range  from 22%—77% (Stotts and  Davis 1960, Reed 1970, Reed 1975, Krementz et al.  1991, Laperle  1974, Belanger  et al.1998, Maisonneuve  et al.  2000, Petrie  et al.  2000).  Hatching  success is high (>75%) but  can be variable  due to seasonal ﬂooding (Mendall  1949). Mean brood size of age-class III ducklings ranges from
3.8–7.0 (Ringelman  and  Longcore 1982, Seymour  and  Jackson  1996, Longcore et al.  1998).  Brood survival
(i.e.,  ﬂedged ≥ 1 duckling)  ranged  from 0.49 in Quebec  to 0.81 in southern Maine  (Reed  1970, Ringleman and Longcore 1982). Mean duckling  survival  in southern Maine was 0.42 (Ringleman  and Longcore 1982).

Paired  males leave their  mates  during  incubation and  join non-breeding  males to molt  across the  breeding range.   Molting  areas  include  the  Hudson  and  James  Bay  regions,  northern Manitoba, Ungava  Bay,  and coastal Labrador (Palmer 1976, Bowman and Longcore 1989, Bowman and Brown 1992). Molting males make limited  movements  (mean  0.2 km/day) during  this  period  and  exhibit  high survival  rates  (0.89;  Bowman and  Longcore  1989).  Males also exhibit  high site  fidelity  to molting  grounds  (Bowman  and  Brown  1992). Females  typically molt on or near their  breeding  grounds  (Longcore  et al.  2000b).

The  black  duck  is classified as a partial-short distance  migrant  (Longcore  et al.  2000b).  In general,  black ducks  migrate  south  through the  Atlantic and  Mississippi  Flyways  beginning  in early  September.  Band recovery  data   suggest  birds  that breed  in  northern Ontario   and  parts   of northwestern  Quebec  migrate through the  Great  Lakes  region  to  winter  in the  upper  (e.g.,  Michigan  and  Ohio)  and  middle  (southern Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee)  Mississippi  River  and  Tennessee  River  systems  (Addy  1953, Longcore  et al.
2000a).  Birds that breed in southern Ontario  and southeastern Quebec appear  to stage on the Great  Lakes


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    17

and  then  move south  to either  the  middle  Mississippi  River  or southern Atlantic coast  (e.g., western  shore of Virginia,  North  and  South  Carolina) (Addy  1953, Longcore  et al.  2000a).  Breeding  birds  from central and northern Quebec, Labrador and Newfoundland  migrate  south  and winter  along the U.S. Atlantic Coast (Maine  to  North  Carolina) (Addy  1953, Longcore  et  al.   2000a).   Some breeding  birds  in Prince  Edward Island,  Nova  Scotia,  New Brunswick  and  Maine  migrate  very  short  distances  or  not  at  all  (Addy  1953, Longcore et al.  2000a).  The  timing  of fall migration is not  well understood, but  is probably  inﬂuenced  by weather,  food abundance, and  hunter disturbance (Longcore  et  al.   2000b).   Recent research  suggests  the distribution of black ducks in fall and winter  in the Mississippi Flyway  is inﬂuenced by temperature (Brook et al.  2009). In warmer  years black ducks appear  to not migrate  as far south  and winter  in the Great  Lakes region.

Our understanding regarding  spring migration is even more limited than  fall migration. This is due, in large part,  to the lack of band recoveries outside the fall hunting season.  Recent work using satellite  telemetry and global positioning  technology  suggests black ducks  follow the  same migratory paths  during  fall and  spring migration. Black ducks are typically among the first species to arrive on northern staging  areas and quickly occupy breeding  wetlands  as the  ice thaws (Wright 1954, Chaulk  et al.  2007).  Mechanisms  controlling  the timing  and duration of spring migration are poorly understood.

Estimates of black duck survival are typically based on band recovery models.  Black ducks have been banded annually  since the  1950s as part  of an  international harvest management program.   The  vast  majority of bandings  occur prior  to the  hunting season  (August  and  September), though  black  ducks  were commonly banded  during  the  post-hunting season (January–March) through the  1970s.  Band  recoveries are obtained through hunter harvested birds and recapture of live birds during  pre- and post-season  banding  operations. Mean annual  survival typically ranges from 0.46 to 0.67 with adult  males exhibiting  the highest  and juvenile females the  lowest survival  rates  (Table  3).  Causes  of black  duck  mortality include  hunter harvest, mam­ malian  and  avian  predation, exposure,  disease,  and  environmental contamination.  Exposure  is a leading cause of mortality of ducklings  up to 18-days post-hatch (Longcore  et al.  2000b).

Black ducks use a broad array  of wetlands  and associated  uplands  to meet their annual  habitat requirements (Fig.    6).    Wetland types including  beaver  ponds/ﬂowages,  salt  and  emergent marshes,   freshwater   and brackish  ponds, streams  and ﬂooded bottomland stands  are used throughout the year.  Green-tree  reservoirs and  ﬂooded croplands  provide  habitat during  migration and  winter  particularly in the  upper-  and  middle- Mississippi River system (Longcore et al.  2000b).  Tidal  ﬂats and brackish  marsh  are critical  components  of black duck migration and winter  habitat along the Atlantic coast.

Black ducks are omnivorous.  Vegetative material  comprises  the majority of black duck diet throughout the year (Table  4), but  animal  material  is obligatory  during  the  nesting  and  wintering  periods (Longcore  et al.

2000b).   Ducklings  feed almost  exclusively  on insects  until  18 days  post-hatch.  After  this  time  ducklings begin  feeding  on  plants  including  seeds  and  leafy material.  Black  ducks  will eat  corn  (Zea  mays)  when available  (Longcore  et  al.   2000b).   The  diet  of wintering  black  ducks  in Virginia  was comprised  of 73% animal matter, 16% vegetation and 10% seeds (Eichholz  et al.  2010). Black ducks selected for invertebrates, including  scuds  (Amphipoda),  land  snails  (Ellobiidae),  mud  snails  (Hydrobiidae),  mussels  (Mytilidae),  and shrimp  (Palaemonidae) (Eichholz  et  al.   2010).   Previous  work in New Jersey  indicated  black  duck  diets consisted  of 91% animal  matter (Costanzo and  Malecki  1989).   However,  the  composition  of the  animal matter differed between  the two studies.  The salt marsh  snail (Melampus  bidentatus) was the primary  food source in New Jersey,  whereas amphipods  were the primary  food sources in Virginia.

Intra-  and inter-specific  interactions vary by season.  Male black ducks defend territories during  the nesting period from conspecifics and mallards.  Territory size varies by the habitat type in which the nest is located. Mean territory size in Nova Scotia  was 0.16–3.8 ha (Seymour  and  Titman 1978).  Results  of research  con­ cerning  black  duck  and  mallard  competition for nest  sites  and  winter  food resources  are equivocal.   Black

ducks typically form single-species ﬂocks during the non-breeding  season, but will also form loose ﬂocks with mallards  and other  species that occur on southern wintering  areas.




LIMITING FACTORS



Black duck population growth is inﬂuenced by a multitude of density-dependent and independent factors that occur at  multiple  spatial  and  temporal scales.  These  factors  can limit  the  population by decreasing  either productivity (i.e.,  reproduction and  recruitment of young  into  the  fall population) or  seasonal  survival. Limiting  factors  also  are  dynamic  so it  is useful  to  categorize  them  into  immediate   (i.e.,  on-going)  and emerging (i.e., long-term)  threats. For example, the loss and degradation of habitat due to human  activities (e.g., housing development along coastal  marshes)  is an immediate  threat to black duck conservation (Fig.
7).


Emerging threats such as climate change may exacerbate existing limiting factors or introduce  new ones (Fig.

7; Seavy et al.  2008). Depending  on the rate and magnitude of change (i.e., changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns) climate  change may only cause an intensification of existing limiting factors.  For example, the combination of urbanization and rising sea level (due to climate change) along the Atlantic coast


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    21
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



will result  in an accelerated loss of winter  habitat and  a decline in winter  carrying  capacity.  Alternatively, black  ducks  may  also experience  new limiting  factors  such  as novel diseases  introduced to  eastern  North America as a result  of warmer  and wetter  conditions.  The keys to addressing  both  immediate  and emerging threats are to understand: 1) the functional  relationships between density,  habitat characteristics, and black duck  vital  rates,  2) how management  can inﬂuence  these  relationships to  increase  the  targeted vital  rate, and 3) how climate  change will inﬂuence habitat characteristics and the associated  relationships with black duck vital  rates.

The primary  (hypothesized) limiting factors affecting black ducks are:  1) habitat loss, 2) habitat degradation,

3) inter-specific competition, and 4) harvest. The mechanisms  of each of these limiting  factors  and the vital rates  each inﬂuences  are detailed  below.  Importantly, it is safe to assume  all of these  factors  are occurring and  inﬂuence  black duck population growth  and  sustainability.  The  important questions  are which factors are having  the greatest impact  and which factors  are amenable  to management.



Habitat Loss


Habitat loss is clearly the most important limiting  factor  contributing to the historic  decline of black ducks and  limiting  future  growth.   Black  duck  habitat is lost through a variety  of mechanisms  on the  breeding grounds  and  migration/wintering areas.   Assuming  black  duck  population dynamics  are regulated through density-dependent and  independent mechanisms  the  loss of habitat (regardless  of cause or location)  should result  in decreased  survival  and  or productivity (Fig  8).  For  example,  the  loss of habitat may cause black ducks  to  congregate  in higher  densities  during  the  winter  resulting  in greater  exposure  to  avian  diseases and  increased  mortality.  Important diseases  that may  inﬂuence  black  ducks  include  duck  virus  enteritis, Newcastle  disease virus and  avian  inﬂuenza.  On the  breeding  grounds,  habitat loss results  in fewer nesting sites  thus  limiting  reproduction.   The  loss of brood  rearing  wetlands  to  agriculture or urbanization may increase duckling mortality and decrease recruitment into the fall population.

Black ducks have experienced a loss of breeding habitat from the boreal forest south through historic breeding areas in North  Carolina.  In the boreal forest region, habitat has been lost as the result of the construction of hydro-electric dams (particularly in Quebec and Labrador), mining operations, and timber  harvest  (Fig.  9). The development of the electrical  resources, particularly hydroelectric, is a primary  component of Quebec’s economy (Quebec  Ministry  of Natural Resources,  accessed 28 July  2010). The development of hydroelectric facilities began in the mid 1900s and in 1971 the James Bay Hydro-electric  Project  ﬂooded 11,500 km2 in the northern part  of the black duck range in Quebec.  The Quebec Ministry  of Natural Resources estimates the current hydroelectric generating  capacity  in Quebec is approximately 43,000 Megawatts (MW)  and plans to develop an additional 4,500 MW between  2007 and  2010 (Quebec  Ministry  of Natural Resources,  accessed

28 July 2010). In Newfoundland  and Labrador there are approximately 35 hydroelectric facilities and a total of 87 provincial  generating  sites (Newfoundland and  Labrador Ministry  of Natural Resources,  accessed 28
July  2010). Hydroelectric  facilities have also been developed in Ontario  and New Brunswick.


Mineral  development  is also an  important part  of Canada’s  economy.   Quebec  currently has  28 metallic and non-metallic  mining operations  and another  17 in development (Quebec  Ministry  of Natural Resources, accessed 18 July 2010). Between 2003 and 2007 mineral  exploration expenditures in Quebec increased 350% from $134 million (Canadian) to  $470 million.   The  Quebec  government expects  the  mineral  development sector to continue  growing in the near future  (Quebec Ministry  of Natural Resources, accessed 28 July 2010). Labrador and Newfoundland  have 14 active mines and 9 mines in development (Newfoundland and Labrador Ministry  of Natural Resources, accessed 28 July  2010). Mineral exploration in Newfoundland  and Labrador accounted  for $55 million (CAN)  in total  expenditures in 2009 and  is forecasted  to be $72 million (CAN) in 2010.  Future development of these  operations  will result  in further  reduction of carrying  capacity  for breeding  black  ducks.   Notably,  the  Provinces  of Ontario  and  Quebec  independently announced strategic plans in 2009 referred  to as the Far  North  Initiative in Ontario and Plan  Nord in Quebec.  These plans call for the protection of 50% of the landscape  (north of the 49th and 50th parallels,  respectively)  for recreation and  natural resources  conservation, but  will allow economic development of the  remainder. Ultimately, the amount of black duck habitat that could be potentially lost or conserved  under  these programs  will depend on which type of activities  occur, and where.

The  rate  of habitat loss has been greater  in southern Canada  (Bird  Conservation Regions 12, 13, and  14) than  in northern Canada  (Bird  Conservation Regions 8 and 7).  Importantly, southern Canada  is considered the traditional core of black duck breeding  range.  This region historically  accounted for 20% of the breeding population in Quebec  and  60% in the  Maritimes  (Spencer  1979).  In Nova  Scotia  >61%  of the  saltmarsh has been diked and  drained  since European settlement began  in the  1600s (Eastern Habitat Joint Venture
2008). Habitat loss in this region has been the result  of agricultural and industrial development and urban­ ization  (Belanger  and  Lehoux 1994).  The  transition from forage production and  dairy  farming  to intensive agricultural activities  in southern Quebec  has  resulted  in increased  forest  fragmentation, straightening of streams,  and  drainage  of wetlands  (Maisonneuve  et al.  2006).  The  Lower Great  Lakes/St. Lawrence  Plain has experienced  more significant impacts  on habitat than  in any other  area of Ontario  having lost 68% of its original wetland  area since European settlement (Snell 1987). Over 90% of wetlands  in southwestern Ontario have been converted  to other  land uses (Snell 1987).

The greatest rate  of wetland  loss in the U.S. occurred  between  1950s and 1970s (coinciding  with the period of greatest decline in black  duck  abundance) (Frayer et al.  1983).  In the  northeast U.S. wetland  loss has averaged  25%–50% since European settlement (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1998).  Though  the rate  of loss has  slowed  since  the  1970s (corresponding with  the  Clean  Water   Act  and  Wetland Reserve

Program), forested  wetlands  continue  to decline due to agriculture, urbanization, and  conversion  to other types  of wetlands  (Hefner  et  al.  1994).  Between  1973 and  2000 the  eastern  U.S. experienced  a 2.3% net loss of forested  land  resulting  in a cumulative loss of 3.7 million hectares  (Drummond and  Loveland  2010). Across the  eastern  U.S. the  leading causes of forest loss were mechanical  disturbance (i.e., timber  harvest), development  (i.e.,  urbanization), and  mining  (Drummond and  Loveland  2010).   Mechanical  disturbances also caused  the  net  loss of 273,000 ha of wetlands.   Importantly, the  leading cause of forest (and  associated wetlands) loss in the primary  black duck wintering  areas was development (Fig.  10, Drummond and Loveland
2010). It is more diﬃcult and expensive to restore habitat lost to development than to mechanical disturbance

(i.e., timber  harvest), mining, or agriculture.

Habitat Degradation


The role of habitat degradation in the decline and current limitation of the black duck population is diﬃcult to quantify  but  may be as important as habitat loss. Habitat degradation can occur in many  forms and in­ ﬂuence >1 aspect  of black duck productivity (including  nesting  rate,  nest success, hatch  success) or survival (e.g., duckling, juvenile, and adult). Factors contributing to the degradation of black duck habitat include en­ vironmental pollutants, hydroelectric development, mining, timber  operations, agriculture, industrialization, and urbanization.

Environmental pollutants, such as acid rain have been hypothesized to contribute to the decline of black ducks by degrading  breeding  habitat quality  (Sparling  1990). Acid rain has been shown to decrease the amount of calcium (Ca)  and  phosphorus (P)  and  increase  the  amount of aluminum  (Al) in lakes and  wetlands  across the  northeast U.S. and  eastern  Canada. A decrease of Ca in wetlands  can cause the  reduction or complete loss of aquatic  invertebrates preferred  by black ducks and result in reduced clutch size and eggshell thinning, which in turn  can reduce hatching success (Scheuhammer 1991). Black duck broods (age 1–36 days) avoided high acidic wetlands  (Parker et al.  1992).  Changes  in Ca, P, and Al caused slower growth  rates  in terms of body weight, culmen, wing, and tarsi  lengths  and weakened bones of both  black duck and mallard  ducklings (Sparling  1990).  The  slower growth  rate  could increase  duckling  mortality due to exposure  and  predation. Long-term  monitoring of lakes in Sudbury,  Ontario  suggests  aquatic  communities, including  acid-sensitive fish, benthic  invertebrates, and  zooplankton recovered  over a 10-year  period  following a 50% reduction in sulphur  (Keller  et al.  1992).  However,  monitoring by the  Canadian Wildlife Service indicated  that about
70% (n=600) of lakes in 3 regions (including  Sudbury) showed no change in acidity status between 1988–1997 (Environment  Canada-Canadian Wildlife Service,  accessed  22 March  2010).  These  data  suggest  acid rain may currently limit black duck productivity.

Habitat degradation as a result of artificially high lead concentrations was historically  an important mortality factor  (Bellrose 1959). In Tennessee  survival  was negatively  correlated  with blood lead levels (Samual  et al.
1992), but  since the  passage  of non-toxic  shot  laws the  importance of lead poisoning has decreased.   After the  band  on lead shot  was implemented the  prevalence  of elevated  blood lead in black ducks in Tennessee declined  by  44% (Samual  and  Bowers  2000).   However,  lead  shot  is not  the  only  source  of lead  in  the environment.  The  majority of black  ducks  (96%) wintering  at  Sullivans  Pond  in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia had blood levels >100 parts  per billion (ppb)  and 76% had detrimental levels (>200 ppb; Daury  et al.  1993). Researchers  concluded  automobile emissions were the primary  source of lead causing the elevated  blood lead levels in black  ducks  (Daury  et  al.   1993).   Other  environmental contaminants that reduce  the  quality  of black duck habitat include agricultural runoff, coastal oil spills, municipal  waste water,  industrial pollutants, and  atmospheric deposits,  and  a variety  of chemical  compounds  (Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture:   waterfowl implementation plan 2005). These pollutants may result  in decreased  survival  or reproduction.

Timber  harvest  occurs throughout the black duck breeding range, but  its impact  on black duck productivity is equivocal.  Forests  cover 761,100 km2  in Quebec and consists of 3 major forests types including hardwood, mixed, and boreal.  Approximately 55% of the total  forest area is considered  commercially  productive. The boreal  forest,  which supports the  most  breeding  black  ducks,  covers 551,400 km2   and  approximately 35% of this  area  has  been  set  aside  for forest  production Quebec  Ministry  of Natural Resources;  accessed  20
July  2010).  In Ontario, forested  lands  cover 71 million ha  of which 8.5% is in protected areas.   However, approximately, 48.4% of Ontario’s  boreal  forest  is currently unavailable for harvest  Ontario   Ministry  of
Natural Resources;  accessed  28 July  2010) for a  variety  of regulatory and  commercial  reasons.    Timber

harvest   in  New Brunswick  has  been  around  45 million  m3

between  2003 and  2007 and  in  2007 lumber
production in Newfoundland  totaled  130 million board  feet (Milley 2008).  Depending  on the  amount, size, and number  of cuts in relation  to the natural matrix  of the forest, timber  operations may increase predation on nesting  hens and eggs by creating  edge and travel  corridors  for predators. It may also decrease duckling survival  by altering  water  quality  and  food availability. Alternatively, slash created  by timber  harvest  may increase  nesting  cover and  nest  success.  Recent research  in southern Quebec  suggested  timber  harvest  did not  inﬂuence  short-term black  duck  breeding  distributions (Darveau et  al.   2008).  In the  long-term,  it  is hypothesized that the density  and success of nesting  black duck are positively  related  to the area of forested wetlands.



Figure  11:  Example  of clear  cuts  in  Quebec.   Timber  harvest  increases   forest  edge and  travel corridors  for mammalian predators and  increases  disturbance  which may  negatively  impact  black ducks (photo credit  Quebec Ministry  of Natural  Resources).



Agricultural activities  may  also  reduce  habitat quality  resulting  in  depressed  nesting  rate,  nest  success, hatching success,  and  chick  survival.   Agricultural activities, such  as clearing  forested  area  and  filling or draining wetlands,  altering streams,  and planting crops reduce wetland complexity on the landscape.  Wetland complexity  is a function  of the  number,  size, and  shapes  of wetlands  and  connecting  streams  in an  area. Black  duck  breeding  density  and  potentially nesting  success  are  hypothesized to  be positively  correlated

with wetland  complexity  (Hanson  2001).  Black duck densities  were higher in forested  and dairy  landscapes (>39 indicated   breeding  pairs  [IBP]/100   km2)  than  in  croplands  (8  IBP/100 km2)  in  southern Quebec (Maisonneuve  et al.  2006).  Agricultural activities  may  also increase  hen,  nest,  and  duckling  predation by facilitating movement of predators among  and  between wetlands.   Agriculture may contribute to increased duckling  mortality via run-off resulting  in decreased  water  quality  and  invertebrate abundance. In general, black  duck  breeding  density  is negatively  correlated with  the  area  of corn,  plowed  fields and  deciduous forest (Maisonneuve  et al.  2006) suggesting  landscape  changes from forested and coastal wetland  systems to agricultural landscapes  degraded  black duck habitat quality  and  contributed to the  decline of black ducks. The  continued conversion  of forested  and  coastal  wetland  areas  to  agriculture continues  to  operate  as  a limiting  factor.

Human disturbance including non-consumptive activities  and generic urban  activities  may result in decreased habitat quality.   Black ducks exhibit  heightened  sensitivity to human  disturbance (including  recreation and presence  of buildings)  compared  to  other  waterfowl  species  (Conomy  et  al.   1998, Morton  et  al.   1989). Black  ducks  respond  to human  activities  by increased  altertness, ﬂushing,  and  less time  feeding or loafing (Morton  et al.  1989, Cramer  2009).  This  relationship may cause increased  mortality by limiting  energetic intake  during  critical  periods,  such as winter  (Morton  et al.  1990) or by exposing black ducks to predators during  ﬂushing  events.    In  southern New  Jersey  it  is predicted   that adult   females  could  survive  freeze events for 2.8–3.9 days based on energy reserves and juvenile females could survive for 1.4–2.1 days (Cramer
2009).  Increased  human  disturbance in loafing or feeding areas  could result  in reduced  energetic  reserves and increased  mortality during  freeze events.



Inter-Speciﬁc Competition


Competition occurs when 2 species use the  same limited  resources  or harm  each other  when seeking those resources (Krebs  1994), resulting  in depressed  growth  rates,  abundances, and distributions of 1 of the com­ peting  species  (Gotelli  1998,  Case  2000).   Several  forms  of competition have  been  recognized  including exploitive  (i.e.,  resource)  competition, interference  competition, and  pre-emptive competition (Krebs  1994, Gotelli  1998, Case 2000).  Exploitive  competition occurs when one species suppresses  another  through use of a shared  resource.   Interference competition occurs  when  one species harms  another  in the  process  of obtaining a resource, even if it is not limited.  Interference competition is thought to be asymmetric with one species dominating the other(s). Pre-emptive competition is a mix of exploitive and interference  competition (Gotelli  1998).  Pre-emptive competition occurs when species compete  for space as a limiting  resource.  An example  of pre-emptive competition is when species compete  for limited  nesting  cover.

Simultaneous to the decline of the black duck during  the latter half of the 20th century  was an expansion  of

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



the  mallard  into eastern  North  America.  The  expansion  of the  mallard’s  range and  increased  abundance is believed to be due to human  alteration of the landscape  (i.e., agricultural development, forest fragmentation, and urbanization) throughout black duck range and the release of pen-reared mallards.  Based on the pattern of decreasing  black ducks and increasing  mallards  several authors hypothesized the cause of the black duck decline  was inter-specific  competition with  the  mallard  (Barclay  1970, Ankney  et  al.   1987, Belanger  and Lehoux  1994, Merendino  and  Ankney  1994).  Ultimately, several  forms of black  duck-mallard competition have  been  proposed  including  competition for breeding  wetlands  (i.e.,  pre-emptive competition;  Longcore et  al.    1987),  mates  (i.e.,  exploitive  competition;  Brodsky  and  Weatherhead 1984),  and  food  resources (exploitive  competition; Butcher  1990, Clark  1996, Carriere  and  Titman 1998).  The  two species are  very similar  genetically  and  ecologically thus  setting  the  stage  for competition.  Further,  field and  laboratory studies  provide  circumstantial evidence of competition (Conroy  et al.  2002).  However, it is unclear  if the increase  in mallards  is the  ultimate or proximale  cause  of the  black  duck  decline  or simply  a concurrent event.

Mallards  are not the only potential black duck competitors. During the past  2 decades the distribution and abundance of greater  snow goose (Anser  caerulescens  atlantica) and Canada  geese (Branta canadensis) have increased  across black duck wintering  range.  Several populations of Canada  geese are sympatric with black ducks on the winter range including the North Atlantic population, Southern  James Bay population, Atlantic population and  temperate-breeding population.   The  Atlantic population experienced  a rapid  increase  in population size between  1999 and  2007 when  the  population grew from  77,000 pairs  to  > 196, 000 pairs (a  260% increase).   The  primary  winter  grounds  of the  Atlantic population are  the  Delmarva  Peninsula, southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey  and  New York  which  are  also  the  primary  black  duck  wintering grounds.   Similarly,  the  temperate-breeding populations of Canada  geese have  increased  throughout black duck  winter  range.   The  rapid  growth  of geese has been fueled by milder  conditions  on their  breeding  and wintering  grounds  and  increased  food availability (particularly corn)  on wintering  grounds.   The  increased abundance of geese may be contributing to the  degradation of black duck feeding areas  along the  Atlantic coast,  particularly in the  Chesapeake  Bay  region.   Geese,  especially  snow geese, feed in large  ﬂocks and typically feed on roots and rhizomes of important black duck food items including  bulrushes  and salt-marsh cordgrass.    Control  measures  have  been  implemented to  limit  or  reverse  the  growth  of snow  geese and temperate-breeding Canada  goose populations.



Harvest


Researchers  and  managers   have  posited  that  overharvest was  a  contributing,  if not  the  primary,  factor responsible for the decline of black ducks between the 1950s and 1980s (Grandy 1983, Rusch et al.  1989). In


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    31
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



response to the long decline of black ducks the Humane  Society of the U.S. brought a legal challenge arguing that black duck harvest  was excessive (Grandy 1983). Harvest  restrictions were implemented in 1983 and 1984 in the  U.S. and  Canada, respectively,  with the  goal of reducing  harvest  by 25%. Analysis of band  recovery data  suggest black duck harvest  rates (across all age and sex classes) decreased after implementation of these restrictions (Francis  et al.  1998). However, these data  do not indicate  that harvest  was the only or primary cause of the  black  duck  decline (Rusch  et  al.  1989).  Currently, black  duck  harvest  is managed  according to a constant harvest  rate  strategy. This  strategy was designed to provide  annual  harvest  opportunity and maintain the  population at  or above the  1998–2007 breeding  population average.  This  strategy is expected to be in place until  2012 when it will be replaced  by a fully Adaptive  Harvest  Management strategy.  The goals of the Black Duck Adaptive  Harvest  Management framework are:  1) maintain a black duck population that meets legal mandates and provides  consumptive and non-consumptive use commensurate with habitat carrying capacity, 2) maintain societal values associated  with the hunting tradition, and 3) maintain equitable access to the black duck resources between  and within  the U.S. and Canada.

Total  harvest  and  harvest  rates  can be inﬂuenced  indirectly  via habitat management. Black  duck  harvest and harvest  rates  may be inversely related  to the amount of habitat available.  Though  it is probably  not a linear  relationship (because  hunter numbers  may increase  with  increased  habitat and  access) it is assumed more  habitat will decrease  hunter density  and  pressure  (in  effect, providing  refugia)  and  decrease  overall harvest  and harvest rate.  Natural mortality factors during  fall are not currently believed to limit population growth.




CONSERVATION STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS



Population Goal


A population goal for the  black  duck  has been established under  the  auspices  of the  NAWMP.  The  initial

NAWMP  goal was 350,000 ducks  as estimated by  the  mid-winter  inventory  (MWI).  As part  of the  2004

NAWMP  update the  black  duck  population goal was translated into  a goal of 640,000 indicated  breeding birds  based  on a statistical relationship between  the  MWI  and  initial  results  of CWS’ Eastern Breeding Waterfowl  Survey.   This  breeding  population goal is incorporated into  the  Black  Duck  Adaptive Harvest Management (BDAHM)  framework  currently under  development. This  goal was also used by the  ACJV  to step  down state-specific  wintering  objectives.  However, the  currently-employed, interim  black duck harvest strategy established  a population goal based  on the  long-term  (1998–2007) breeding  population estimate covering a greater  portion  of the breeding range than  is considered in the 2004 NAWMP  and BDAHM goals.

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



The  EHJV  has established its population goal based  on a different spatial  extent than  that used for either the  2004 NAWMP  goal or the  interim  harvest  strategy.  As part  of the  current  NAWMP  revision  process the  BDJV,  associated  habitat joint ventures, and  potentially the  BDAHM  community will re-evaluate the goal of 640,000 breeding  birds  and may make a recommendation for either  revising the  numeric  population goal or converting  to an estimated carrying  capacity  goal needed to support a desired population size. The focal species recovery  plan for the  black duck adopts  the  current NAWMP  population goal and  subsequent revisions.



Management Actions and Strategies


The  decline of the  black duck population coincided with  a rapid  and  expansive  alteration of the  landscape across the species’ range.  The changes, including the loss of forested and coastal wetlands,  urbanization, and expansion  of agricultural activities  undoubtedly resulted  in a drastic  reduction of the  continental carrying capacity  for the black duck.  The restoration of the black duck to desired levels will require a combination of habitat conservation, adaptive management, and research  to reduce key uncertainties.



Habitat Conservation Planning and Delivery


Habitat conservation actions  that will contribute to increasing  the  continental carrying  capacity  for black ducks and the black duck population include (Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture  2005):




Habitat Protection –



1.  Fee title  acquisition:  Acquisition  of lands to be owned by a conservation agency or organization and managed  for wildlife conservation in perpetuity. Major partners include the state  fish and wildlife and land conservation agencies, National  Wildlife Refuges, National  Forests,  non-government conservation organizations.

2.  Conservation easements:    Conservation  easements  with  private   landowners   and  local  governments should  be used  to  acquire  legal interests to  conserve  and  manage  important wetlands  and  associ­ ated  upland  habitats and  limit  development  while allowing  some use by  the  landowner  consistent with  the  easement conditions.   These  easements  may be particularly effective in working landscapes including  working forests and farms where the use of the land is consistent with wildlife habitat con­ servation.

the  easement conditions.   Easements to be generally  held by a federal,  state  or regional conservation agency or organization with  the  resources  to monitor  and  enforce the  easement conditions.   Identify and review potential current and future  limiting  factors  (i.e., conservation threats).

3.  Cooperative agreements:   Agreements  with  corporations, government  agencies,  private  landowners, and other organizations should be used to protect wetlands and integrate compatible  land use practices that benefit wetlands  and associated  upland  habitats.

4.  Leases:  Long-term  leases with  private  landowners,   corporations, and  other  private  entities  can  be used to implement wetland  protection and management activities.

5.  Financial  incentives:   Develop  state  and  local legislation  that would  provide  financial  benefits,  i.e., alteration in property taxes  to  individual  landowners,  to  encourage  protection and  conservation of wetlands  and associated  upland  habitats.


Habitat Restoration –



1.  Restore  tidal  wetland  hydrology:   Restore  ﬂow to  tidal  creeks  and  marshes  that has  been  cutoff  or reduced  by  placement  of roads,  dikes,  and  undersized  culverts  resulting  in a major  change  in the marsh  structure and often resulting  in the invasion  by Phragmites.

2.  Restore  drained  wetlands:   Restore  drained  and  ditched  wetlands  by eliminating  drains  and  ditches, restoring  hydrology  and planting or seeding wetland  plants  where needed.

3.  Restore  Riparian Systems:   Restore  the  natural ﬂow of streams  and  ﬂoodplain  wetlands  that have been straightened or altered.


Habitat Enhancement and Management –



1.  Improve water  level management on managed  wetlands:   Upgrade  existing  federal,  state,   and  other managed  wetlands  areas  by  providing  adequate water  control structures,  dikes,  etc.,  to  maximize management opportunities and  improve  the  quality  of waterfowl  breeding,  wintering,  and  migration habitats.

2.  Restore  vegetation to impacted  wetlands:  Implement measures  to restore  natural vegetation and im­ prove  the  health  and  productivity of wetland  habitats that have deteriorated due to human  impact and overgrazing  by snow geese and other  impacts  resulting  in loss of vegetation.

3.  Restore  converted  wetlands:  Where  appropriate, restore  forested  wetlands  that have been converted to other  wetland  types through planting and management.

4.  Open marsh  management: Implement management measures  to improve  water  surface and  tidal  ex­ change in saltmarsh ecosystems  by plugging ditches  and  creating  ponds and  channels  for the  benefit of black ducks.

5.  Restore  and manage riparian  buffers: Establish and restore riparian buffers through planting, stream- bank  fencing and other  techniques.

6.  Beaver management:  Where  applicable,  encourage,  develop,  and  support state  beaver  management policies and programs  that would manipulate beaver  populations to improve habitat for black ducks, other waterfowl, and wildlife. Also, install devices that allow for beaver-enhanced wetlands but prevent ﬂooding of roads.

7.  Control  exotic and invasive species: Eliminate or suppress  the spread  of invasive and exotic plants  in wetlands  through the use of physical, biological, or chemical agents.  Eliminate or suppress population growth  of invasive animal  species through the use of trapping or hunting.

8.  Prescribed burning:  Use prescribed  fire to restore  natural fire-dependent ecological communities such as coastal  grasslands  and heathlands.

9.  Implement Farm  Bill:  Work  with  NRCS  to  implement Farm  bill  conservation programs  including Conservation Reserve Program, Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, Wetland Reserve Pro­ gram,  Wildlife Habitat Incentive  Program and others  to enhance  wetlands  and buffers in agricultural areas.

10.  Enhance  habitat on federal lands:   Work  with  federal  agencies  such  as  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Defense to develop and assist in the implementation of programs  that would better manage  and enhance  waterfowl  habitats on federal lands.


Other  Conservation Actions  Benefiting  Waterfowl  Habitat –



1.  Review regulatory legislation  and enforcement:  Evaluate existing  wetland  protection legislation  and work with ongoing programs  to strengthen or improve existing federal-state wetland  protection efforts and  to facilitate  wetland  management activities.  Coordinate with  the  EPA,  the  Corps  of Engineers, and  appropriate state   agencies  to  implement wetland   protection provisions  of the  Federal  Water Pollution Control  Act.

2.  Streamline regulation  for beneficial projects:   Encourage  and  support measures  that would facilitate implementation of management actions  in wetlands  to benefit waterfowl  and other  wildlife.

3.  Mitigation: Work with federal and state  regulatory agencies to ensure mitigation policies and mitiga­ tion actions  resulting  from development projects  result  in enhanced  wetland  management opportuni­ ties.

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



4.  Information and education:  Develop  informational-educational leaﬂets/brochures,  audio-visual  pro­ grams,  and  other  techniques   to  generate  public  interest and  support for  waterfowl  and  wetlands conservation.

5.  Extension eduction  on best management practices:  Develop how to information for private  landown­ ers.  Utilize existing network  or develop and implement an extension  education program  to encourage private  individuals  to conserve  and  manage  wetlands  and  associated  habitats and  utilize  best  man­ agement practices.

6.  Public  use management:  Carry  out  public  education  efforts and  provide  public  use opportunities in a manner  compatible with reducing  or eliminating  disturbance to feeding or loafing waterfowl during critical  winter  periods.

7.  Watershed protection and management:   Eliminate degradation of wetland  health  and  productivity by  municipal  waste,  agricultural runoff,  sedimentation, and  industrial contaminants by  developing guidelines and providing  input  to watershed  management and estuary  plans.

8.  Predator management:  Monitor  predator populations on  federal  and  state  waterfowl  management areas and implement appropriate programs  to reduce depredation in problem  areas.

9.  Eliminate waterfowl release:  Eliminate releases of captive waterfowl to the wild to reduce competition for  wintering  habitat between  released  birds  and  wild  birds.    Eliminate state   and  private   release programs  to  reduce  potential for pair  bonding  between  wild and  released  stocks  within  a species, reduce  the  likelihood  of pair  bonding  and  hybridization between  released  mallards  and  mottled or black ducks, and reduce the potential for spread  of disease between  released birds and wild stocks.

Development of Integrated Habitat and Harvest Management  Frameworks



Black  duck  conservation is hampered by incomplete  knowledge of system  dynamics  that work at  multiple spatial  and temporal scales.  The implementation of an adaptive management framework  that will allow for the simultaneous implementation of strategic management actions and increase our understanding of system dynamics  is key to effective conservation of the  species.  There  are 3 phases  to developing  a framework  to inform both  harvest  and habitat management:


•  Development of a Black Duck Adaptive  Harvest  Management process.  The goal of this  project  is to ensure that harvest  is maintained at biological and socially sustainable levels.

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    36

–  Status:  on-going



•  Development of an Adaptive  Management framework  that links black duck seasonal vital  rates  (i.e., survival  and  productivity) to habitat characteristics. The  goal of this  project  is to develop a frame­ work that aids  land  managers  with  habitat  conservation planning  and  delivery  while reducing  key uncertainties about  the system.

–  Relative  priority:  High

–  Estimated completion  date:  FY 2014

–  Status:  on-going



•  Integrate adaptive harvest  and habitat management frameworks  into a unified framework.

–  Relative  priority:  Medium,  elevate  to High upon completion  of the first 2 phases.

–  Estimated completion  date:  To be determined.

–  Status: not started




Development  of novel and improvement  of existing monitoring programs to in­

form adaptive management



Estimating annual  black  duck  population characteristics, including  abundance, distribution, sex and  age structure, and  vital  rates  (i.e.,  survival  and  productivity) is critical  to restoring  the  population to desired levels.  Results  of monitoring programs  form the  basis  of black  duck  adaptive management and  allow re­ searchers  and  managers  to  assess  model  predictions, evaluate  population responses  to  management, and evaluate  progress  toward  desired  goals.   In addition  to  maintaining current monitoring programs  priority monitoring needs include:


•  Development and  implementation of two-season banding  program  to  provide  annual  estimates   of seasonal survival.

–  Relative  priority:  High

–  Estimated completion  date:  FY 2015

Implementing research to address priority information needs



Researchers  and managers  have considerable  interest in understanding the causes of the decline in the black duck population and potential corrective actions.  Despite research  efforts, there is no clear consensus among researchers  and  managers  as to the  principal  cause(s)  of the  black duck decline or current limiting  factors. Assumption driven  research  is critical  to improving  our understanding of black  duck  population dynamics and limiting factors and the refinement of adaptive management models.  Priority research  needs will change over time as our understanding of the system increases and conditions  on the landscape  change.  The BDJV coordinates  and provides financial support for research designed to address priority  information needs related to  black  duck  ecology and  management.  As part  of the  research  program  the  BDJV  maintains a current list of high priority  research  needs (below).  Priority information and research  needs for the black duck focal species plan will follow the recommendations of the BDJV  research  program.  Interested parties  are referred to the BDJV’s research  program  for a complete  list of current research  needs.


•  The goal of habitat management is to improve local conditions  for black ducks and increase carrying capacity  and ultimately increase ≥ 1 targeted vital rates (i.e., survival or productivity), thus increasing population size over time.   However,  researchers  and  managers  do not  currently understand how or at  what  scale black  ducks  respond  to  habitat management (e.g.,  restoring  tidal  wetland  hydrology, predator control)  or which activities  are most effective at increasing  carrying  capacity  and vital rates.

–  Assess changes in black duck seasonal vital  rates  (survival  or productivity), density,  and distri­

bution  in response to habitat management activities  (at  the local and landscape  scale).

∗  H0  Habitat management has no affect on black duck density  or targeted vital  rate(s).

∗  H1  Habitat management increases black duck density,  but  not the targeted vital  rate(s).

∗  H2  Habitat management increases the targeted vital  rate(s), but  not density.

∗  H3  Habitat management increases black duck density  and targeted vital  rate(s).

∗  H4  Habitat management increases black duck density  and decreases targeted vital rate(s).

∗  Important covariates  to consider  are initial  density  of black ducks,  abundance and  distri­ bution  of mallards  in the study  areas, landscape  composition  and condition,  type and scale of habitat management activity  implemented, and weather  conditions  during  the study.


•  Researchers  and managers  have posited that waterfowl breeding success is inﬂuenced by a bird’s body condition  during  winter  and spring migration (i.e., cross-seasonal  body condition). If this hypothesis is true  habitat management on the  wintering  and  spring  migration routes  can  increase  subsequent breeding  success and population size.


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    39
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



–  Assess changes in black duck body condition  during  winter  and spring migration in response to habitat management activities.

∗  H0  Habitat management has no affect on black duck body condition during winter or spring migration.
∗  H1  Habitat management increases black duck body condition  during  spring and or winter.

∗  H2  Habitat management decreases black duck body condition  during  spring and or winter.

∗  Important covariates  to consider  are initial  density  of black ducks,  abundance and  distri­ bution  of mallards  in the study  areas, landscape  composition  and condition,  type and scale of habitat management activity  implemented, and weather  conditions  during  the study.


•  Researchers and managers  hypothesize wintering black ducks are limited by the availability and quality of food resources during  the non-breeding  season indicating  habitat management activities  should be designed to increase the amount and quality  of food available  to black ducks.

–  Assess the ability  and effectiveness of habitat management activities  to increase the amount and quality  of food resources.

∗  H0  Habitat management has no affect on the abundance or quality  of food resources.

∗  H1  Habitat management increases the amount or quality  of food resources.

∗  H2  Habitat management decreases the amount or quality  of food resources.

∗  Important covariates  to consider  are initial  composition  and  abundance of food resources on the study  area.


The challenge to addressing  these priority  information needs is being able to conduct  and replicate  manipula­ tive experiments throughout the black duck range and over time, both short-term (1–2 years post-treatment) and long-term  (5–10 years post-treatment).  Understanding how black ducks respond to habitat management will require the synthesis of results from directed  research and monitoring in an adaptive management frame­ work.




PROGRESS EVALUATION



The  success of black duck management must  be evaluated at  multiple  spatial  and  temporal scales.  At the continental scale, the  success of black duck conservation efforts will be evaluated by comparing  the  annual estimated breeding  population to the established NAWMP  population goal. At the regional scale, estimated

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



seasonal  abundance (obtained from  breeding  survey,  winter  surveys,  or other  data) will be compared  to regional population goals stepped-down from the  NAWMP  continental goal.  Based  on regional population goals,  habitat joint  ventures  will develop  goals for the  number  of acres  that must  be protected, restored and  managed.   Progress  toward  acreage  goals will be reported annually  by the  habitat joint  ventures  and other  land  management partners.  Additionally, the  BDJV  and  the  habitat joint ventures  are  developing winter  habitat goals based  on energetic  carrying  capacity  (assuming  black  ducks  are limited  in the  winter by food availability). Once these objectives  are developed land managers  will be able to evaluate  success by estimating changes in energetic  carrying  capacity.

APPENDIX A:  Habitat management  goals and needs for  the Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture planning area

(Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture 2005)


The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture  has targeted more than  45 million hectares  (¿113 million acres) for conser­ vation  actions  that will benefit black ducks, waterfowl and other  wetland  dependent wildlife (Atlantic Coast Joint Venture  2005). Target areas that will benefit black ducks are described  below.

Connecticut River, Connecticut


This  wetlands  and  river  focus area  consists  of over 20 individual  tidal  wetland  units  and  river  islands  of various  sizes occurring  along a 40-mile (64 km) stretch of the  lower Connecticut River  from Old Saybrook to  Cromwell.   The  focus area  encompasses  11,426 hectares  (28,234  acres).   Taken  as  a whole,  this  focus area represents a gradation of tidal  wetlands  from a very narrow  zone of relatively  high salinity  marshes  at the  mouth  of the  Connecticut River  where  it  enters  Long Island  Sound,  through an  intermediate zone of brackish,  lower salinity  wetlands,  to extensive  freshwater  tidal  marshes  and  ﬂoodplain  forests beginning  at Deep River and extending  upriver  to Cromwell.

Of  the  23 wetland/island units  comprising  this  focus  area,  at  least  14 (61%)  are  in  need  of protection and/or management, either  wholly or in part.   While  some are  entirely  privately owned,  many  have  some form  of protective ownership.    Several  of these  areas  contain  individual   parcels  owned  and  managed  by the  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection or by conservation groups  such  as The  Nature Conservancy, Connecticut River Gateway  Commission  and various  Town conservation and land trusts.

Approximately 468 hectares  (1,157 acres) of tidal wetlands  within  the focus area require acquisition  and/or enhancement.   Of this  figure,  approximately 364 hectares  (900  acres)  are  privately owned  and  could  be considered in jeopardy  and in need of acquisition.  New programs  in place, such as the Landowner  Incentive Plan,  could allow for the restoration and enhancement of many of these privately-owned wetlands.  Statewide, no estimate  of wetlands  in need of acquisition  and/or enhancement is available.

Since  1988,  approximately 193 hectares (479  acres)  of wetland  habitat within  the  focus area  have  been enhanced.   Enhancement has been achieved  through the  use of open marsh  water  management techniques. An additional 191 hectares  (474 acres)  have  undergone  intensive  vegetation control  (Phragmites control). Statewide, in areas outside  of ACJV  focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres) of inland  wetlands have  undergone  either  enhancement  or restoration activities.  An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres)  have been controlled  for exotic vegetation.

Conservation Recommendations:  A substantial portion  of this  nationally significant tidal  marsh  complex remains  unprotected and/or is not being effectively managed  so as to maintain its high species and habitat diversity  and to optimize  fish and wildlife productivity. The current complicated  ownership pattern necessi­ tates  establishment of cooperative  management and  conservation agreements among  all parties  in order  to protect this valuable  ecosystem in its entirety rather than  by any piecemeal approach. Such an arrangement could include zoning ordinances  and other  restrictions to maintain or enhance existing land uses.  Aggressive management of invasive  species such  as the  Mute  Swan  and  common  reed  need  to  be pursued.    Habitat degradation of protected areas  is occurring  due to lack of aggressive management.  Acquisition  of adjacent upland  habitats should  be actively  pursued  to  provide  buffers to  existing  wetlands.    Restoration of tidal marshes  through open marsh  management techniques  may be appropriate in some areas.

Fishers  Island  Sound,  Connecticut


This major estuary  complex encompasses  all of Fishers  Island Sound and Little  Narragansett Bay, including the coastline  of southeastern Connecticut from the mouth  of the Thames  River to Watch  Hill, Rhode Island, and the north  shore of Fishers  Island,  New York.  This large, estuary-dominated complex includes all of the waters  and  adjacent shorelines  of Fishers  Island  Sound,  or that body of water  lying between  Fishers  Island (New York) and the southeastern coast of Connecticut, and enclosed within  the area east of a boundary line drawn from the mouth  of the Thames River at Avery Point (Groton) to the western end of Fishers Island, and north  of a line drawn from the eastern  end of Fishers Island to and including Napatree Point (Rhode  Island) and  Little  Narragansett Bay.   This  area  is approximately 13 miles (21 km)  long in a southwest-northeast direction,  and  from 2 to  5 miles (3-8 km)  in width  in a north-south direction  between  the  mainland  and Fishers  Island  and encompasses  10,421 hectares  (25,750 acres).

This  complex  has  a  mixed  ownership  pattern of Public  Trust waters,   several  State-owned areas,  Town parks  and extensive  private  residential lands.  State  of Connecticut-owned areas include Bluff Point Coastal Preserve  and  State  Park,  Haley Farm  State  Park,  Sixpenny  Island  Wildlife Area  and  Barn  Island  Wildlife Management Area.  The Town of Westerly,  Rhode Island,  owns Napatree Point.

Approximately 103 hectares  (256 acres)  of tidal  wetlands  within  the  focus area  need  acquisition  and/or enhancement.   Of  this  figure,  approximately  80 hectares   (200  acres)  are  privately owned  and  could  be considered in need of acquisition.  New programs  in place, such as the Landowner  Incentive  Plan,  could allow for the restoration and  enhancement of many  of these  privately-owned wetlands.   Statewide, no estimate  of wetlands  in need of acquisition  and/or enhancement is available.

Since 1988, approximately 19 hectares (47 acres) of wetland habitat within the focus area have been enhanced. Enhancement has been achieved through the use of open marsh water management techniques.  An additional
3.6 hectares  (9 acres) have undergone  intensive  vegetation control  (Phragmites control).  Statewide, in areas

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



outside  of ACJV  focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres)  of inland  wetlands  have  undergone either enhancement or restoration activities. An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres) have been controlled  for exotic vegetation.

Conservation Recommendations:  The  apparent abandonment of several  area  nesting  beaches  of terns  and Piping  Plover  as a result  of human  disturbances is of particular concern,  and  requires  intensive  efforts to protect both  currently-occupied sites as well as recent historical  localities by all available  means,  including beach closures, fencing, predator/pet removal,  posting,  beach warden  patrols  and public education. Habitat improvement and  restoration of degraded  or abandoned nesting  beaches  using  dredging  spoils should  be considered.  Efforts should be made to identify and implement those tasks and objectives of the Piping Plover and Roseate  Tern  recovery plans that may be applicable  to areas within  this complex.  Opportunities should be sought to  develop  cooperative  management and  conservation programs  between  various  governmental agencies,  private   conservation organizations and  private   landowners  to  best  manage  and  protect for the long term  the  living resources  of this  significant estuarine complex.   Protection and  maintenance of water quality  and  wetlands  throughout this  complex through monitoring and  regulation  are necessary  to ensure the continued high value of this area to fish, wildlife and plant populations dependent on them.

Greater Hammonasset Complex, Connecticut This complex is located along the central  coast of Connecticut on the  north  shore of Long Island  Sound,  between  the  Towns  of Madison  and  Westbrook and  encompasses
3,182 hectares  (7,863 acres).  The boundary of this complex extends  west to east from the nearshore  area of Tuxis Island and the adjacent Connecticut mainland  to Menunketesuck Island,  a distance  of about  12 miles (19 km), and inland  to the limits of anadromous fish passage up the Hammonasset, Indian,  Menunketesuck and  Patchogue Rivers.   In addition  to those  areas  mentioned, the  following areas  are  also included  within this  complex:  Tuxis  Island,  Hammonasset State  Park  and  marshes,  Cedar  Island,  Clinton  Harbor,  Harbor View Beach, Hammock  River wetlands,  Indian  River wetlands  and Duck Island.

Ownership  is a mixed pattern of public  lands  and  waters  and  private  lands,  including  Hammonasset State Park  and  Natural Area  Preserve,  Hammock  River  Marsh  Wildlife  Area,  Black  Pond  Wildlife  Area,  Salt Meadow Unit  of the  Stewart B. McKinney  National  Wildlife Refuge and  Duck Island  Wildlife Area  (Con­ necticut Department of Environmental Protection).  Menunketesuck Island  is privately owned; Tuxis  Island is owned by the Town of Madison.

Approximately 142 ha (353 acres)  of tidal  wetlands  within  the focus area need acquisition  and/or enhance­ ment.  Of this figure, approximately 121 hectares  (300 acres) are privately owned and could be considered in need of acquisition.   New programs  in place, such as the  Landowner  Incentive  Program, could allow for the restoration and enhancement of many of these privately owned wetlands.  Statewide, no estimate  of wetlands in need of acquisition  and/or enhancement is available.

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



Since  1988,  approximately  44 hectares   (109  acres)  of wetland   habitat within  the  focus  area  have  been enhanced.   Enhancement has been achieved  through the  use of open marsh  water  management techniques. An  additional 19 hectares   (47  acres)  have  undergone   intensive  vegetation control  (Phragmites control). Statewide, in areas  outside  of Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture  focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres)  of inland  wetlands have  undergone  either  enhancement or restoration activities.  An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres)  have been controlled  for exotic vegetation.

Conservation Recommendations:  There  are  numerous  opportunities and  challenges  throughout this  com­ plex for various  governmental agencies, private  conservation organizations and  private  landowners  to work cooperatively  in conserving  and  protecting this  valuable  complex of fish, wildlife and  plant habitats.  Cer­ tain  privately-owned parcels in the Menunketesuck area should be considered  for acquisition  by the Federal government  as additions  to the  National  Wildlife Refuge System  (Salt  Meadow National  Wildlife Refuge) so as to protect and  manage  them  for their  significant regional biological values, undeveloped  upland  areas adjacent to important marsh  habitats should be considered  for acquisition  by federal or state  agencies (e.g. Griswold  Airport, properties  adjacent and  proximal  to Salt  Meadow Unit).   Increased  funding  is necessary for habitat management of early successional habitats at Salt Meadow Unit.

Lower Housatonic  River/Great Meadows,  Connecticut This  marsh/barrier beach/river focus area  encom­ passes  2,840 hectares  (7,017  acres)  and  is located  on  the  southwestern Connecticut shoreline  of western Long Island  Sound  between  the  mouth  of the  Housatonic  River  and  Bridgeport  Harbor.   Portions of the lower Housatonic  River  are also included.   The  area  boundary includes  all of Long Beach,  Pleasure  Beach and  Great  Meadows Marsh,  just  east  of Bridgeport Harbor,  eastward to Lordship  Beach,  the  mouth  of the Housatonic  River,  Milford  Point,   Charles  Island,  and  the  Charles  E.  Wheeler  State  Wildlife  Area  (Nells Island  marshes)  and from there  northward up the river to Derby Dam.

Most  of the  Great  Meadows  marsh  is in public  ownership.    The  majority of the  marsh  is owned  by  the United  States  Fish and Wildlife Service (Stewart B. McKinney NWR).  Long Beach is owned by the Town of Stratford. There is a colony of beach cottages  at the western end of Long Beach that is leased from the Town. The Town cooperates  with State  personnel  in managing  the shorebird  nesting  area on Long Beach.  Milford Point includes Federal  (Stewart B. McKinney National  Wildlife Refuge) and privately-owned (CT Audubon) parcels.  The  Connecticut Audubon  leases this  piece of Milford Point from the  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. Nells Island/Wheeler State Wildlife Management Area and several marshy islands upstream are owned and managed  by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.

Approximately 111 hectares  (275 acres)  of tidal  wetlands  within  the  focus area  need  acquisition  and/or enhancement.   Of  this  figure,  approximately  81 hectares   (200  acres)  are  privately owned  and  could  be considered  in need of acquisition.  New programs  in place, such as the Landowner  Incentive  Program, could

allow for the restoration and enhancement of many of these privately-owned wetlands.  Statewide, no estimate of wetlands  in need of acquisition  and/or enhancement is available.

Since 1988, approximately 16 hectares (41 acres) of wetland habitat within the focus area have been enhanced. Enhancement has been achieved through the use of open marsh water management techniques.  An additional
10 hectares  (25 acres) have undergone  intensive  vegetation control  (Phragmites control).  Statewide, in areas outside  of ACJV  focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres)  of inland  wetlands  have  undergone either enhancement or restoration activities. An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres) have been controlled  for exotic vegetation.

Conservation Recommendations:Acquisition of privately-held saltmarsh adjacent to publicly owned habitats should  be aggressively  pursued.   Diverse partnerships between  governmental and  non-governmental groups need to be developed to pursue  funding for acquisition  and continued habitat restoration. State  and Federal programs  to protect and enhance water quality  in Long Island Sound and adjacent waters should continue  to focus on protecting tidal  freshwater  and brackish  wetlands  and coastal  water  quality  through  the regulatory process and  in addressing  the  problems  of hypoxia,  oil spills, non-point source pollution,  sewage and  waste disposal and  heavy metal  contaminants in these  waters  to restore  and  maintain important fish and  wildlife habitat.

Lower Thames  River  System,  Connecticut This  area  encompasses  the  lower tidal  reaches  of the  Thames River in southeastern Connecticut from New London and Groton  at the mouth  to Norwich.  The boundary of this site includes the river channel,  waters and shoreline wetlands  of the lower tidal  reaches of the Thames River from the conﬂuence of the Shetucket and Quinebaug Rivers a few miles north  of Norwich to the mouth of the  river at  New London  and  Groton  where it enters  into  the  eastern  end of Long Island  Sound,  a river length  of approximately 19 miles (31 kilometers).  Specific areas of biological significance, in addition  to the river  itself, include  the  Mamacoke  Island  marshes,  Horton  Cove, Poquetanuck Cove marshes,  Smith  Cove, Greens  Harbor  and  small rocky islands  at  the  river  mouth.   The  focus area  is 2,121 hectares  (5,242 acres) in size.  This  area  is primarily  Public  Trust waters  and  State  and  private  conservation and  research  lands. Connecticut College owns and manages  Mamacoke  Island  Natural Area.

Approximately 20 hectares  (50 acres)  of tidal  wetlands  within  the  focus area  need acquisition  and/or  en­ hancement. All of these  wetlands  are privately owned and  could be considered  in need of acquisition.   New programs  in  place,  such  as  the  Landowner  Incentive  Plan,  could  allow for the  restoration and  enhance­ ment of many  of these  privately-owned wetlands.  Statewide, no estimate of wetlands  in need of acquisition and/or enhancement is available.  Since 1988, no wetland  acreage has undergone  restoration or enhancement. Statewide, in areas outside  of ACJV  focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres) of inland  wetlands have  undergone  either  enhancement  or restoration activities.  An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres)  have

been


controlled  for exotic vegetation.


Conservation Recommendations:Particular attention  needs  to  be focused on restoring  and  protecting the water  quality  of the  Thames  River  and  its  high  value  to  fish and  wildlife populations, especially  anadro­ mous fish and  overwintering waterfowl.   Protective measures  should  include  stringent  regulatory overview and  enforcement of existing  Federal,  State  and  local environmental regulations, as well as developing  and implementing environmentally sound  planning  and  zoning policies and  restoration programs.   Additionally, exotic species such as Mute  Swan and Phragmites need to be aggressively managed  in this focus area.

New Haven Harbor,  Connecticut This complex consists of 10,751 hectares  (26,566 acres).  The focus area is centered  primarily  along the central  coast  of Connecticut on Long Island  Sound,  in the New Haven Harbor area  and  areas  to the  east.   The  outer,  shoreward  boundary of this  largely  nearshore  water  and  tidal  ﬂat- dominated complex  extends  from Merwin  Point,  just  south  of Woodmont (Milford)  east  to  Sachem  Head (Guilford), a distance  of approximately 14.5 miles (23 kilometers).  Enclosed within this boundary are the east and west shoreline areas around  New Haven Harbor  to the limit of anadromous fish passage on the West and Quinnipiac Rivers,  including  the Quinnipiac  Meadows wetlands  area and the North  Haven and Wallingford sand plains north  of New Haven Harbor.  To the east of New Haven Harbor,  the boundary incorporates the Branford  River, Leetes Island and Joshua  Cove marshes  and tidal  ﬂats and nearshore  waters  of Long Island Sound  for a distance  averaging  1-2 miles (2-3 kilometers)  south  of the  shoreline.   A number  of important wildlife islands  in the  Branford-Guilford vicinity  are included  within  this  nearshore  water  boundary, most notably  The Thimbles  and Kelsey Island.

A significant portion  of this  complex includes  public  coastal  and  river  waters  and  wetlands,  while the rest represents various  mixtures  of publicly and privately owned lands.  Several of the islands are privately held, as is most of the sand plains area along the Quinnipiac River.

Approximately 242 hectares  (598 acres)  of tidal  wetlands  within  the  focus area  need  acquisition  and/or enhancement. Of this figure, approximately 210 hectares  (520 acres)  are privately-owned and could be con­ sidered in need of acquisition. New programs  in place, such as the Landowner  Incentive Program, could allow for the restoration and enhancement of many  of these privately owned wetlands.  Since 1988, approximately
5.6 hectares  (14 acres)  of wetland  habitat within  the  focus area  have  been  enhanced.    Enhancement  has been achieved through the use of open marsh  water management techniques. An additional 43 hectares  (107 acres) have undergone  intensive vegetation control (Phragmites control).  Statewide, in areas outside of ACJV focus areas,  approximately 187 hectares  (463 acres)  of inland  wetlands  have undergone  either  enhancement or restoration activities. An additional 182 hectares  (452 acres)  have been controlled  for exotic vegetation.

Conservation Recommendations: Protection of the  nearshore  waters  and  intertidal ﬂats  from catastrophic events  such  as an  oil spill or hazardous chemical  discharge  needs  to  be given the  highest  priority  among resource  concerns  in this  area.  Attention needs to be focused not only on formulating oil spill contingency plans,  but  developing  the  highest  degree of readiness  to respond  to such an event,  particularly during  crit­ ical times  of the  year  when wildlife populations are at  their  peak and  most  vulnerable, such as spring  and fall migrations  and  winter.   Measures  should  also be sought and  instituted, whether  by regulation, zoning, planning,  cooperative  agreements or full-scale restoration programs  such as the National  Estuary Program, to restore,  maintain, enhance  and  protect aquatic  and  terrestrial resources  in this  complex.  Opportunities should be identified  to restore  or enhance  degraded  wetlands,  including  control  of common reed, and  other coastal  habitats in this complex to increase their  value to fish and wildlife. A regional or basin-wide  conser­ vation  and management plan should be developed and implemented for protecting and enhancing  wintering waterfowl populations in central  and western Long Island Sound, in partnership with governmental agencies, private  conservation groups and landowners.

Upper Thames  River Watershed, Connecticut The Upper Thames  River Watershed Planning Area is located in northeast Connecticut and  encompasses  376,548 hectares  (941,371 acres).   This  entire  watershed, most of which lies within  the  administrative boundaries  of Connecticut, contains  10 individual  river  sub-basins and is critical  to breeding  and staging  waterfowl in Connecticut. Wetland habitat is distributed throughout the  planning  area,  often in the  form of forested  wetlands  or small emergent-wetland complexes.  The  entire watershed  lies within that portion  of Connecticut that is presently  least developed.  The Upper Thames  River Watershed is predominantly forested,  with  large tracts of privately  owned agricultural land.   Development pressure,   however,  is increasing,  and  from  the  period  1990-2002, the  percent  of the  watershed   classified as developed  has  increased  9.4% (University of Connecticut 2004).  Developed  land  now comprises  11.9% of the  entire  watershed.  With  increased  development come declines  in water  quality  and  loss of habitat. Degradation of water  quality  in the upper  reaches of the watershed  becomes magnified downstream as ﬂow enters  the Thames  River and,  ultimately, spills into Fishers  Sound and Long Island  Sound.

The  376,548 hectares  (930,466 acres)  of the  watershed  that lie within  Connecticut is a patchwork of both private  and  public  land  holdings.  The  state  of Connecticut owns significant acreage  throughout the  water­ shed in the  Goodwin  State  Forest  (SF),  Natchaug SF, Nipmuck  SF, and  Pachaug SF. Several Department of Environmental Protection-owned wildlife management areas are also within  the boundaries  of the water­ shed.  Private conservation groups such as the  Windham Land  Trust and  Audubon  Society have small, but significant,  holdings within  the planning  area.

New programs  in place, such as the Landowner  Incentive Plan,  could allow for the restoration and enhance­ ment of privately owned  wetlands  within  the  planning  area.   Within  the  planning  area,  there  are  32,732 hectares  (80,884 acres)  of wetlands  or open water.   There  is no reasonable  estimate  of acreage  to conserve


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    56
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



within  that figure, however, of the total  watershed, approximately 20,234 hectares  (50,000 acres) of forested and non-forested  emergent wetlands  exist in the watershed. Less than  half of those acres are currently pro­ tected  either  through their  location  on state  controlled  or non governmental organization (NGO)  controlled lands.  Statewide, no estimate  of wetlands  in need of acquisition  and/or enhancement is available.

Conservation Recommendations:Land-use planning  that maximizes  wetland  conservation and  open  space needs to be actively  pursued  by municipalities within  the  planning  area.   Many  towns  within  the  planning area are developing plans that maximize biological diversity  and open space.  On a regional scale, this must continue.    Regional  planning  committees comprising  several  adjacent municipalities have  arisen  in  other parts  of the  state,  and  it is not unreasonable that these  types of regional arrangements will proliferate  into this watershed. Aggressive management of invasive species such as the Mute  Swan, Phragmites, and purple loosestrife need to be pursued.   Manpower  and  funding  constraints have resulted  in habitat degradation of protected areas in this planning  area.  Additionally, water  level manipulation on state  owned impoundments is necessary.  Acquisition of adjacent upland  habitats should be actively pursued  to provide buffers to existing wetlands.

Bayshore  Focus  Area,  Delaware  The  Bayshore  Focus  Area  encompasses  approximately 165,054 hectares (407,857 acres) of land of. Approximately 23,876 hectares  (59, 000 acres or 15%) is protected at the federal or state  level or by private  interests. The area stretches south  from the Cedar  Swamp Wildlife Management Area approximately 84 kilometers  (52 miles) to Lewes and is bounded  on the eastern  edge by the Delaware Bay and Estuary.

Examination of the 2002 Land Use Land Cover data  for Delaware indicates  the predominant landuse practice in the  Focus  Area  is agriculture, which  utilizes  approximately 71,705 hectares  (177,187 acres  or 45%) of upland  habitat. The  remaining  land  is comprised  of wetlands  and  deep water  habitat (26%), forests (11%) and  residential, commercial  and  industrial development (18%).  The  Bayshore  Focus Area contains  some of the most natural and undeveloped  wetlands  remaining  in the state  of Delaware.

Much of this  region has already  been conserved  or protected for wildlife by federal and  state  agencies and other  private  entities  24,123 hectares  (59,611 acres).  However, 85% of it still remains  in private  ownership. Realizing the importance of this Focus Area to migratory waterfowl and shorebirds the federal government has preserved two large tracts of land along the coast which total  over 10,117 hectares  (25,000 acres):  Prime Hook National  Wildlife Refuge and Bombay Hook National  Wildlife Refuge.  In addition, the state  of Delaware has protected approximately 10,117 hectares  (25,000 acres) of habitat at Woodland  Beach Wildlife Management Area (WMA),  Little Creek WMA, Ted Harvey Conservation Area, Milford Neck Wetland Management Area and Prime  Hook Wetland Management Area to name just  a few. The marshes  and impoundments on these state  lands are managed  to maximize use by waterfowl and shorebirds.  Finally,  two non-profit  organizations,

The Nature  Conservancy  and Delaware  Wild Lands  Inc., have contributed significantly  to the protection of habitat for waterfowl  within  the  Bayshore  region by purchasing approximately 3,327 hectares  (8,000 acres) of land.

Conservation Recommendations: Efforts should focus on protecting, restoring  and  enhancing  wetlands  and associated  uplands  in areas  adjacent to protected lands  with  the  goal of forming large contiguous  tracts of undisturbed habitat within the Bayshore Focus Area.  Public and private  partnerships should be developed to utilize existing funding programs  and manage development in a responsible manner  to maintain populations of wetland  dependent migratory birds  and  biodiversity.  Long-term  protection should  be favored;  however, multiple  ten-fifteen  year  agreements for restoration and  enhancement will be a primary  tool  to  maintain wildlife populations.

Blackbird Focus Area, Delaware The Blackbird Bay to Bay Focus Area stretches from the Maryland/Delaware border to the Delaware Bay.  It encompasses the Blackbird  River watershed, Appoquinimink River watershed and part of the Chester  River watershed  approximately 36,247 hectares  (89,568 acres).  Of this land,  44% is in agricultural use, 27% is wetland  habitat and 12% is forest habitat.  Approximately 4,856 hectares  (12,000 acres) of land has been protected at the state level (Blackbird State  Forest,  Blackiston  Wildlife Area, Cedar Swamp Wildlife Area, Augustine  Wildlife Area and the C&D Canal Wildlife Area) (Earth Data  International of MS, LLC., 2003). The remaining  17% is in some form of residential, commercial or industrial development. Protection and/or restoration  of the  remaining  freshwater  tidal  and  non-tidal  wetlands,  brackish  marshes and associated  upland  habitat within  this portion  of the state  are critical  to wintering  waterfowl.

Approximately 85% of the  land  in Delaware  is privately owned and  the  Blackbird  Bay to Bay Focus  Area is no exception.  Approximately 4,856 hectares  (12,000 acres)  of land (13%) has been protected at the state level (Blackbird  State  Forest,  Blackiston  Wildlife  Area,  Cedar  Swamp  Wildlife  Area,  Augustine  Wildlife Area and the C&D Canal  Wildlife Area).  The remaining  land within  the Blackbird  Bay to Bay Focus Area is privately owned and subject  to increasing  development pressure.  This increasing  desire to move out of the cities and into the country  is the largest threat to waterfowl habitat within the state  of Delaware.  Protection and/or restoration of the remaining  wetlands  and associated  upland  habitat within  this portion  of the state are critical  to wintering  waterfowl.

Conservation Recommendations: Protect,  restore  and  enhance  wetlands  and  associated  uplands  wherever and whenever opportunities arise within  this Blackbird  Bay to Bay Focus Area.  Work with other  public and private  partnerships to utilize existing funding programs and manage development in a responsible manner  to minimize disturbance and maintain populations of wetland  dependent migratory birds and biodiversity.  Long term protection should be favored; however, multiple  10-15 year agreements for restoration and enhancement will be a primary  tool to maintain wildlife populations.

Inland  Bays,  Delaware  The  Inland  Bays  Focus  Area  is approximately 45,324 hectares  (111,998 acres)  in size stretching from Lewes south  to Bethany Beach.  It  is bounded  on the  east  by the  Atlantic Ocean  and encompasses  the  Indian  River  Bay,  Little  Assawoman  Bay  and  Rehoboth Bay  and  their  tributaries.  The Inland Bays and adjacent upland area are comprised of 15,093 hectares  (37,297 acres) of wetland  that support over 8,000 ducks  and  geese (Waterfowl Surveys  in Delaware,  2004).  Ninety-two  percent of the  Inland  Bay Focus Area is in private  ownership.  The  remaining  8% is owned by the  State  of Delaware.  Cape  Henlopen State  Park,  Delaware  Seashore State  Park,  Holts Landing,  Love Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Bluff Point WMA  and  Assawoman  WMA  are  the  only  protected areas  within  this  focus area.   However, recreational use of some of these  properties  has  rendered  them  less desirable  to  wildlife than  undisturbed natural habitat.  With  such  a high  percentage  of the  land  in this  focus area  in private  lands  it  becomes increasingly  important to  work  with  these  landowners  to  come up  with  cooperative  solutions  to  habitat management.

Conservation Recommendations:Protect,  restore  and  enhance  wetlands  and  associated  uplands  wherever and whenever opportunities arise within  the Inland  Bays.  Develop public and private  partnerships to utilize existing  funding  programs  and  manage  development in a responsible  manner  to  maintain populations of wetland  dependent migratory birds  and  biodiversity.   Long-term  protection should  be  favored;  however, multiple  10-15 year agreements for restoration and enhancement will be a primary  tool to maintain wildlife populations on private  lands.   Restoration and  protection in the  Inland  Bays  Focus  Area  will compliment other  efforts within  the  region  to  address  habitat destruction and  overall  water  quality  in the  Bay.   Such ongoing efforts include:  Delaware Inland  Bays Estuary Program, Livable Delaware and Green Infrastructure Program and the Agriculture Preservation Program.

Nanticoke  Focus  Area,  Delaware  The  Nanticoke  Focus  Area  is defined by the  boundaries  of the  Nanticoke watershed  and encompasses  over 121,406 hectares  (300,000 acres) of land within  the state  of Delaware.  The Focus  Area  is 28 kilometers  (17 miles)  wide stretching from  the Maryland state  line on the  west  to  the Redden  State  Forest  on the  east  and  59 kilometers  (36 miles)  long from  Hollandsville  in the  North  and to the  Maryland state  line in the  south.   The  watershed  itself is the  largest  watershed  within  the  state  of Delaware  covering 1/3  of the  States  surface.  Total  focus area  size is 127,459 hectares  (314,959 acres).   An examination of the 2002 Land Use Land Cover data  for Delaware indicates  that the predominant land types in the Nanticoke  Focus Area are agricultural lands,  wetlands  and mixed forests.  Agricultural lands account for 54% of the  land  cover within  the  region.   Wetlands account for 20% of the  land  within  the  Nanticoke Focus Area and mixed forests make up 16% (Earth Data  International of MD, LLC, 2003).

Past  initiatives by State  agencies  and  private  entities  have  been  able  to  protect and/or enhance  approxi­ mately  8,903 hectares  (22,000 acres) of land preserving  much of the integrity of the Nanticoke river shoreline and  upland  buffers.   The  state  of Delaware  has  protected nearly  8,498 hectares  (21,000  acres  of land  on

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



Marshyhope  Wildlife Management  Area  (WMA),  Old Furnace WMA,  Nanticoke  WMA,  Trap  Pond  State Park  and Redden Forest  among others.  In addition  The Nature  Conservancy  has preserved over 161 hectares (400 acres)  on the  Middleford  North  Tract in the  upper  tributaries of the  Nanticoke  Watershed.  The  re­ maining 118,553 hectares  (292,951 acres or 93%) are in immediate  need of attention as development pressure and agricultural/sivilcultural practices  continue  to grow.

Conservation Recommendations: Protect, restore and enhance wetlands and associated uplands wherever and whenever  opportunities arise within  this Nanticoke  Focus Area.  Develop public and private  partnerships to utilize existing funding programs  and manage development in a responsible manner  to maintain populations of wetland-dependent migratory birds  and  biodiversity.  Long-term  protection should  be favored;  however, multiple  10-15 year agreements for restoration and enhancement will be a primary  tool to maintain wildlife populations on private  lands.

Cobscook  Bay,  Maine  The  Cobscook  Bay  Focus  Area  boundaries  extend  from  northeast of Machias  Bay along the  coast of Maine  to the  Canadian border  and  encompasses  109,432 hectares (270,411 acres).   The boundaries  continue  along the  United  States/Canada border  across  the  mouth  of Cobscook  Bay  and  into the  St.  Croix River  as far as the  town  of Calais,  Maine.  It extends  inland  approximately 20-30 kilometers (12-18 miles) encompassing  all of Cobscook Bay and  several large freshwater  lakes including  Pennamaquan and  Boyden  Lakes.  Cobscook Bay is a complex of inlets,  bays,  tidal  creeks, and  rivers with  approximately
156 kilometers (97 miles) of shoreline and is recognized as one of the most outstanding habitats in Maine and the northeastern United States  (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). These large tides create huge expanses of mudﬂats  that benefit and  large expanses  of ice-free areas  for wintering  black ducks.  The  majority of the Cobscook  Bay  focus area  is under  private  ownership.   Public  ownership  includes  the  Moosehorn  National Wildlife Refuge located  in two divisions within  the focus area.  In addition, the State  of Maine owns several state  parks  including  Cobscook Bay and Quoddy  Head State  Parks.

Conservation Recommendations: The most pressing need within the focus area is to protect available habitat through fee simple or easement acquisition.   The  Moosehorn  NWR  has an active  acquisition  program  that has  resulted  in a number  of acres  secured  adjacent to  both  the  Baring  and  Edmunds Units.   The  highest priority  areas should be shoreline properties  around  Cobscook Bay and interior  lakes and streams.

Downeast  Maine  The  Downeast  Focus  Area  is located  in central  and  eastern  coastal  Maine  and  includes hundreds of miles of relatively  undeveloped  coastline  that encompass  676,569 hectares  (1,671,832  acres). Marine  and  estuarine habitats within  this  focus area  are  particularly significant black  ducks.   Large  tidal amplitude combined with gentle topography and many freshwater  tributaries and rivers in this region provide extensive intertidal mud ﬂats in protected bays.  Saltmarsh systems occur at the mouths  of the tributaries in estuarine areas.  Historically,  many  of these  saltmarshes were ditched  for mosquito  control  and/or salt  hay

farming.   Most  of the  land  within  the  focus area  is privately owned.  However, agencies such as the  Maine Department of Inland  Fisheries and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and private  organizations have been  active  within  the  focus area  protecting critical  habitat.  The  State  of Maine  maintains several  state parks and wildlife management areas and federal land managed  by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Petit Manan  National  Wildlife Refuge) and National  Park  Service (Acadia  National  Park)  are also located  in this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  The  relative  undisturbed nature of the  shoreline  and  islands  should  be protected through fee or  easement acquisition   to  prevent any  additional disturbance.   Water   quality  is critical  to  the  integrity and  diversity  of habitats within  the  focus area.   This  should  be closely monitored especially with the potential for industrial pollution  in the western  portion  of this focus area.

Inland  Wetlands, Maine  Maine  wetlands  provide  breeding  and  migration  habitats of importance to  black duck and other wildlife. Certain wetland  complexes, because of their geographic location and orientation, are of particular importance as migration corridors  and staging  areas.  Breeding  habitats identified  in this focus area are inland freshwater  systems with either historic or current importance as black duck breeding habitats. Waterfowl  use of some of the historically  important breeding areas has declined as some of the wetlands  have been degraded  as dams  have fallen into  disrepair.   In addition  to acquisition  and  enhancement of breeding habitat in this  focus area,  management of statewide beaver  populations to  encourage  maximum  wetland development acceptable  to landowners  will continue  to provide quality  black duck breeding  habitat. Most of the land within the focus area is privately owned.  However, agencies such as the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries  and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (National Wildlife Refuges) and private  organizations have  been  active  within  the  focus area  protecting critical  habitat.  The  State  of Maine  maintains several state  parks  (including  Baxter  State  Park)  within  this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations: The relative  undisturbed nature of the freshwater  wetlands  and associated shoreline  should  be protected through fee or easement acquisition  to  prevent any  additional disturbance. Water  quality  is critical  to  the  integrity and  diversity  of habitats within  the  focus area.   This  should  be closely monitored  especially with the potential for industrial pollution  upriver.  Also, invasive species should either  be eradicated or closely monitored for spread.

Merrymeeting Bay/Lower Kennebec River, Maine The Merrymeeting Bay/Lower Kennebec River Focus Area is located in southern Maine about  50 kilometers north  of Portland and is one of the most important wetland complexes  along  the  northeast coast.   The  focus area  encompasses  55,182 hectares  (136,357 acres)  and  is roughly  divided  between  the  freshwater  tidal  habitats of Merrymeeting Bay and  the  brackish  to saltwater habitats of the Lower Kennebec River.  Merrymeeting Bay is the largest  freshwater  tidal  marsh  north  of the Chesapeake  Bay formed from the  conﬂuence of two large rivers,  the  Kennebec  and  Androscoggin,  and  four

smaller tributaries, the Eastern River, Cathance River, Muddy River, and the Abagadasset River.  Extensive emergent wetlands,  including wild rice, pickerel weed, water parsnip,  and several species of bulrush,  as well as broad  mud ﬂats,  riparian habitats, and a relatively  undeveloped  shoreline are ideal for breeding,  migrating, and  wintering  birds.   In conjunction with  the  freshwater  tidal  marshes  is the  Lower Kennebec  River.   The river enters  Merrymeeting Bay on the  north  and  drains  the  bay to the  south  into the  Atlantic Ocean.  The Kennebec River is characterized by brackish  to saltwater marshes and embayments as well as mudﬂats along a 25 kilometer  (15 miles) stretch from the bay to the mouth  of the river.  The uplands  are composed of a mix of spruce-fir  and  hardwood  forests  interspersed with  agricultural fields and  meadows.   The  forest  extends down to the  high tide  line.  Much of the  land  within  the  focus area  is privately owned.  However, agencies such as the Maine Department of Inland  Fisheries  and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and private organizations have been active within the focus area protecting critical habitat. The state  of Maine maintains several  state  parks  and  the  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service maintain Pond  Island  National  Wildlife Refuge located  at the mouth  of the Lower Kennebec  River.

Conservation  Recommendations:   The  relative  undisturbed nature  of the  shoreline  should  be  protected through fee or  easement  acquisition  to  prevent  any  additional disturbance.   Water   quality  is critical  to the  integrity and  diversity  of habitats within  the  focus area.   This  should  be closely monitored especially with  the  potential for industrial pollution  upriver.    Also,  invasive  species  should  either  be  eradicated  or closely monitored  for spread.

South  West  Coast,  Maine  The  South  West  Coast  Focus  Area  is located  in southern Maine  from the  New Hampshire  border  to  midcoast  Maine,  near  Rockland  but  excludes  the  freshwater  tidal  habitats of Mer­ rymeeting   Bay  and  the  brackish  to  saltwater habitats of the  Lower  Kennebec  River,  as  these  wetlands comprise a separate focus area.  This focus area encompasses 356,340 hectares  (880,532 acres).  The wetlands in this  area  provide  wintering  and  migration habitats for black ducks and  other  waterfowl  where intertidal mudﬂat  and  extensive  saltmarsh habitats occur.   Much  of the  significant  saltmarsh habitats in this  focus area are already  secured in either  state  or federal ownership.  The remaining  saltmarsh habitat in this region occurs in small acreages associated  with the riparian zone of estuarine systems.

Conservation Recommendations: The most pressing need within the focus area is to protect available habitat through fee simple  or  easement acquisition.    The  Rachel  Carson  National  Wildlife  Refuge  has  an  active acquisition  program  that has  resulted  in a number  of acres secured.   The  highest  priority  areas  should  be shoreline properties  around  Casco Bay and interior  lakes and streams  to protect water  quality.

Atlantic Coastal  Bays,  Maryland The  Atlantic Coastal  Bays  Focus  Area  is approximately 62,145 hectares (153,563 acres)  in size and  extends  from Bishopville  at  its  northern end,  south  to  the  Virginia  state  line. It  is bounded  on the  east  by the  Atlantic Ocean  and  encompasses  the  following bays  and  their  associated


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    62

tributaries: Assawoman  Bay, Isle of Wight Bay, Sinepuxent Bay, Newport  Bay, and Chincoteague Bay.  The bays  are  uniform  and  shallow in depth,  (¡ 10 feet in depth), with  limited  tidal  exchange  and  river  input. Groundwater is an important source of freshwater  input.   This  combination of characteristics increases  the susceptibility of the  bays  to  inputs  from  septic  systems,  agriculture, wastewater treatment facilities  and other  non-point sources of pollution  in the  form of nutrients and  chemicals.  Wetlands in the  coastal  bays, especially in the  northern bays,  have decreased  significantly,  an estimated 103,105 hectares  (254,778 acres) lost since settlement of the region.  This loss and/or alteration is the result  of numerous  activities, including conversion  to agriculture, development, and other  human-related land uses.  Large networks  of ditches  have drained  tidal  and  nontidal wetlands  and  the  construction of canals  and  bulkheads  have  further  impacted wetlands  through loss of spatial  extent and deteriorated wetland  quality  or availability to waterfowl.  Much of the Atlantic Coastal  Bays Focus Area is in private  ownership.  The State  of Maryland and National  Park Service own and  manage  Assateague  Island  National  Seashore,  Assateague  State  Park,  and  E.A.  Vaughn Wildlife Management Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Protection, restoration and  enhancement of wetlands  and  associated  up­ lands  should  occur whenever  possible.  Projects  providing  protection in perpetuity are most  desirable,  but shorter-term  conservation agreement private   landowners  need  to  be  incorporated into  planning  and  im­ plementation efforts.   Natural ponds  degraded  by mosquito  control  actions  should  be restored  to  historic conditions.  Reduce the Mute  Swan population to protect critical  bay living resources.

Blackwater/Nanticoke  River,  Maryland The  Blackwater    Nanticoke   River  Focus  Area  is  approximately

162,352 hectares  (401,179 acres)  on the  Delmarva  Peninsula in southeast Maryland, and  encompasses  the Nanticoke  River,  its  associated  watershed, and  Blackwater National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR),  whose most prominent feature  is the  Blackwater River  and  watershed.  The  Nanticoke  River  watershed  covers approxi­ mately  50,585 hectares  (125,000 acres) in Dorchester  and Wicomico Counties.  A large portion  of the water­ shed is forested  (approximately 38%) and  supports the  largest  continuous  pine forest  left on the  Delmarva Peninsula.  Blackwater National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR)  was established in 1933 as a refuge for migratory birds  and  includes  over 10,926 hectares  (27,000 acres),  composed  mainly  of rich tidal  marsh  characterized by ﬂuctuating water  levels and varying  salinity.  The focus area has a number  of large public land holdings, including  Blackwater NWR,  Fishing  Bay Wildlife Management Area (WMA),  and Taylors  Island  WMA.

Conservation Recommendations: Protecting, restoring  and  enhancing  wetlands  should  occur whenever  op­ portunities arise.  There are a number  of Conservation Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Enhance­ ment Program projects  underway  and these programs  should receive continuing  support. Nutria  eradication efforts must  continue,  as well as Phragmites control programs.  Mute Swan populations should be reduced to eliminate  detrimental effects on sea grasses and  other  critical  bay living resources.  Wetland reconstruction should  be implemented on  Blackwater NWR.  Partnerships with  NGOs  (such  as  Ducks  Unlimited, Inc.),


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    63

private  industry and  governments should  continue  to  be supported for work on wetland  conservation and restoration.

Chester  River and  Kent County Bayshore,  Maryland The  Chester  River and  Kent County Bayshore  Focus Area  is approximately 111,430 hectares  (275,348 acres)  in size and  stretches from  the  Elk  and  Bohemia Rivers in the north  to the mouth  of the Chester  River at Love Point.  In addition  to the above named  rivers, the  focus area  includes  the  Sassafras  River  and  more than  40 named  tributaries.  The  primary  land  use in the Chester  River and Kent County Bayshore  Focus Area is agriculture, where high quality  soils grow corn and winter  wheat.  Approximately 1/3  of Marylands  population of Black duck (6,000) utilize the focus area. The  majority of the  focus area  is in private  ownership.   Eastern Neck National  Wildlife Refuge is the  only protected area within  the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations: Efforts should focus on protecting, restoring  and  enhancing  wetlands  and associated  uplands  in areas via public and private  partnerships and existing funding programs.  For example CREP  and CRP programs should be used to levy resources for wetland conservation, specifically shell impoundments.  Long-term  protection should  be favored;  however,  multiple  ten-fifteen  year agreements for restoration and  enhancement will be a primary  tool to maintain wildlife populations on private  lands.  The Mute  Swan population should be reduced  to protect critical  bay living resources.

Choptank River,  Maryland The  Choptank River  Focus  Area  is approximately 120,540 hectares  (297,860 acres)  in size and  extends  from Ridgely  Maryland, downriver  to  the  mouth  of the  Choptank River.   The larger  water  bodies  in the  focus area  include  the Choptank, Little  Choptank, and  Tred  Avon  Rivers  and Broad,  Harris,  and  Tuckahoe  Creeks.   The  Choptank River  Watershed drains  approximately 700 square miles of land  in Maryland, including  portions  of Caroline,  Dorchester, Queen  Annes,  and  Talbot Counties in the  middle  of the  Eastern Shore.  The  Choptank basin  is 58% agricultural, 33% forested,  and  9% urban (Maryland Department  of Natural Resources  website).   Wetlands within  the  focus area  have  been ditched and drained  for agriculture for decades.  Corn, soybeans, and winter wheat are the main commodities  grown. The majority of the Choptank River Focus Area is in private  ownership.  Public  lands include Tuckahoe  and Martinak State  Parks.  The lower portion  of the watershed  is an important concentration area for waterfowl, including  black ducks.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continue to  work  through partnerships to  implement Conservation  Re­ serve Program and  Conservation Reserve  Enhancement  Program to  restore  wetland  habitats in the  focus area.  Restore  SAV throughout the  focus area.  Reduce Mute  Swan population to protect critical  bay living resources.

Eastern Bay,  Maryland The  Eastern Bay  Focus  Area  is approximately 57,254 hectares  (141,477 acres)  in size, is located  on the eastern  shore of Maryland and includes the Wye and Miles Rivers and Bayshore/Kent

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    64

Island.   With  the  eventual  threat of residential  development, the  state  of Maryland purchased a portion  of the  focus area,  Wye Island  Natural Resources  Management Area  (NRMA)  in the  mid 1970’s to ensure  its preservation. Most of the focus area remains in private  ownership with the exception  of Wye Island NRMA. The Eastern Bay Focus Area contains  important wintering  habitat for black ducks.

Conservation Recommendations: Continued support for restoring  Poplar  Island using dredged material  from the  maintenance of the  Baltimore  Harbor  and  Corps  of Engineers  Channels  Federal  Navigation   Project should  occur.   Habitats protected and  restored  by  this  effort  include  323 hectares  (800 acres)  of shallow water  with SAV. Habitat for wintering  waterfowl  should continue  to be created.   Continue to work towards stabilizing  the shorelines within the focus area through partnerships with MD DNR, NGOs and other federal agencies.  The Mute  Swan population should be reduced  to protect critical  Bay living resources.

Patuxent River, Maryland The Patuxent River Focus Area is approximately 67,769 hectares  (167,460 acres) in size, extends  from Prince  Georges County in the  north  to  the  rivers  mouth  in St.   Marys  County, and includes the Western  Branch  and Little  and Middle Patuxent Rivers.  Land use in the focus area consists of high and  low density  development and  agriculture lands.  Because of the  developed  nature of the  Patuxent River Focus Area, urban  non-point and point sources both  account for approximately one-third  of nutrients entering  the  river, while agriculture contributes roughly  one fifth of the nutrients (Maryland DNR).  As the population in the  focus area  increases,  nutrient loads  from these  sources will increase.   Between  1970 and
2000, the population in the watershed  increased  by 136% and is projected  to grow by another  22% by 2020 (Maryland DNR).  The  Patuxent River  Focus  Area  is a mix of private  and  public  lands,  with  the  majority of acreage in private  ownership.

Conservation Recommendations Development pressure  in the Patuxent River Focus Area creates  an urgent need  to  identify,  protect, restore,  and  manage  remaining  wetlands  and  their  associated  upland  habitats. Continued support for ongoing SAV transplanting efforts is a priority.   Mute  Swan control  is underway  and should continue  until populations are reduced to numbers  that no longer negatively  impact  wetland  habitats, waterfowl  and other  migratory bird species.

Tangier  Sound and Bay Islands,  Maryland The Tangier  Sound and Bay Islands Focus Area is approximately

100,350 hectares  (247,969 acres)  in size and  extends  from  Bloodsworth  Island  in the  north,  south  to  the Virginia/Maryland state  line.  The  focus area  includes  Tangier  Sound,  a portion  of Pocomoke  Sound  and their  islands (Bloodsworth Island,  Smith  Island,  Cedar  Island,  and  South  Marsh  Island).  The  focus area is rural  in character; most residents  make their  livelihoods on the water.  Timber  harvest  and poultry  also play significant roles in supporting the local economy.  Pocomoke Sound is famous for waterfowl and rail hunting. A significant portion  of the focus area is in public ownership.  The mainland  portion  of the focus area includes Deal Island  Wildlife Management  Area  (WMA),  Fairmount  WMA,  and  Janes  Island  State Park.   Within

Tangier  and Pocomoke Sounds are Bloodsworth  Island  (used as a bombing  range by the U.S. Navy),  South Marsh  Island  WMA,  Cedar  Island  WMA,  Pocomoke  Sound  WMA,  and  Martin  National  Wildlife Refuge. The  Tangier  Sound  and  Bay  Islands  Focus  Area  supports some of the  best  remaining  bay  grass  beds  in Maryland and  is very  important for Black  duck.   A portion  of the  focus area,  Cedar  Island,  is legendary for its ability  to attract large numbers  of Black Duck due to its 1,214 hectares  (3,000 acres)  of tidal  marsh, ponds and creeks.

Conservation Recommendations: Efforts are underway  to restore  lost wetlands  on the northern end of Smith Island  in  the  Martin  National  Wildlife  Refuge  (NWR).   Tremendous loss of SAV  around  parts  of Smith Island  and  be stopped  and  potentially reversed  by protecting and  restoring  historic  wetland  communities. The  recommended  project  includes  restoration of Back  Cove and  Fog Point Cove using stone  breakwaters and  backfill,  and  protection of the  western  shoreline  of the  Martin  NWR  using  breakwaters and  backfill from  the  northern jetty  near  Ewell to  Fog  Point.    Over  a 50-year  project  life, these  projects  will restore or protect approximately 768 hectares  (1,900 acres)  of SAV and  restore  or protect 97 hectares  (240 acres) of wetlands.   The  Mute  Swan population should  be reduced  to protect critical  Bay living resources.  Other wetland  and bay grass restoration projects  should be targeted for funding and implemented. Partners should continue to work towards  stabilizing the shorelines within the focus area through partnerships with MD DNR, non-governmental organizations and other  federal agencies.

Tidal  Potomac River,  Maryland and  Virginia  The  Tidal  Potomac River Focus Area is shared  by northeast Virginia and southwest Maryland and encompasses 474,376 hectares  (1,172,203 acres) in Virginia and 295,258 hectares   (729,596  acres)  in  Maryland.   The  area  as  a  whole,  especially  upland  habitat, is considerably developed, but the brackish  and freshwater  tidal  wetlands  have remained  relatively  undeveloped  and provide a wide diversity  of habitat for many  waterfowl  species.  The  Potomac River  proper  is owned by the  State of Maryland and  the  adjacent  marshes  are owned by both  Virginia  and  Maryland, on the  respective  sides of the  river.  These  riverine  marshes  are composed  of highly brackish  Spartina marshes  near  the  mouth  of the  Potomac to  freshwater  Peltandra, Lotus  and  wild rice marshes  inland.   Historically,  hardwood  forests dominated areas  beyond  the  river.    These  forests  have  given  way  to  row  crop  agriculture, truck  farms, horse/hobby farms, loblolly pine plantations, and residential  and industrial development. In recent historical times,  the  shallow water  areas  of the  Potomac had  a high-density of submerged  aquatic  vegetation (SAV) beds (Hydrilla).

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide  excellent  waterfowl  habitat and  receive high use in these  areas.   Continued restoration of these  sites  will help  wintering  and  staging  black  ducks.   The Mute  Swan population should be reduced  to protect critical  Bay living resources.

Barnstable Marshes,  MA The Barnstable Marshes lie on the inner coast of Cape Cod which fronts Cape Cod Bay  just  east  of the  Cape  Cod Canal.   Protected from the  full brunt of New Englands  winter  weather  by Sandy Neck, at more than  9 kilometers (6 miles) in length,  the marshes are one of the largest barrier  beaches on the  New England  coast.  The  marshes  provide  haven  for several thousand Black ducks.  The  Barnstable Marshes  encompass  8,300 hectares  (20,511 acres).   There  is no federal  ownership  and  the state  owns only
88 hectares  (219 acres).   However,  there  are  2,082 hectares  (5,147 acres)  in municipal  ownership,  much  of it  in the  Sandy  Neck Reservation, and  nonprofit organizations own another 204 hectares  (505 acres).   An additional 80 hectares  (197 acres)  are privately owned but  protected. The rest is unprotected property.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continue  to  acquire  property and  conservations restrictions within  the Barnstable Marshes Focus Area as done in recent projects  funded by the National  Coastal  Wetlands Conser­ vation  Grant Program. Buzzards  Bay, Massachusetts The Buzzards  Bay Focus Area encompasses  the broad stretch of Massachusetts southern coastline  from Woods  Hole on Cape  Cod to  the  Rhode  Island  line and includes some 59,893 hectares  (148,000 acres).  An irregular  coastline  is created  by the many rivers, streams, harbors,  and  bays that occur along it.  Saltmarsh habitat is limited  to small sites scattered along the  coast throughout the region and total  1,485 hectares  (3,670 acres).  Another  101 hectares  (250 acres) of tidal  ﬂats are found in the region.  Many small off-shore islands and rock outcroppings are found in the region including a series of larger  islands  known as the  Elizabeth Island  Chain  or the  Gosnold  Group.   The  presence  of the Cape Cod Canal  makes inner Buzzards  Bay a major shipping  channel  for both  commercial  and recreational boat  traﬃc.  Sixty  three  hectares  (157 acres)  are federally owned, primarily  by the  Department of Defense. The  state  owns 364 hectares  (900 acres)  and  municipalities, 594 hectares  (1,470 acres).   Non-profit  groups own another 736 hectares  (1,820 acres).

Conservation Recommendations:Many pockets  of saltmarsh in  the  Buzzards  Bay  Focus  Area  have  been historically  ditched  for mosquito  control.  Restoration of these  marshes  to natural tidal  ﬂows would benefit wintering  black duck and other  migratory bird species.  Acquisition  of remaining  undeveloped  shoreline and marshes  will help conserve important waterfowl  wintering

habitats.


Duxbury/Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts The northern portion  of Plymouth Bay contain  the remaining  strips of saltmarsh along this long-settled coastline,  with a major piece of marsh remaining  in Duxbury/Marshfield, protected by  a long barrier  beach.   This  area,  particularly the  tidal  ﬂats  along  the  bay  shorelines,  is an important wintering  site for black duck.  The region encompasses  6,758 hectares  (16,700 acres) including 673 hectares  (1,665 acres)  of saltmarsh.  The  town  of Plymouth is the  location  of both  the  historic  Plymouth Rock site  and  the  Mayﬂower  II is anchored  in Plymouth Harbor.   The  Duxbury  marshes  are  identified  in the  Category  Plan  for Preservation of Black Duck Wintering Habitat  Atlantic Coast  by the  U.S. Fish and

Wildlife Service (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1988).
Conservation Recommendations: Approximately 607 hectares  (1,500 acres) should be protected or enhanced. Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts Located  immediately  north  of Boston,  the marshes along the Pines and

Saugus Rivers are the last remaining  tracts of extensive  saltmarsh in the greater  Boston  metropolitan area. The focus area covers 967 hectares  (2,390 acres) of which 509 hectares  (1,260 acres) are saltmarsh. Dissected by roads and degraded  by illegal dumping  and the invasion of Phragmites, the area still provides habitat for a variety  of wildlife. A smaller area 131 hectares  (325 acres),  including  81 hectares  (200 acres) of saltmarsh located on the north  end of Quincy Bay, coupled with the tidal  ﬂats of the region, provide winter habitat for several hundred  Black ducks.  The  state  owns 279 hectares  (690 acres)  of the  Pines  and  Saugus Rivers area marshes  while another  133 hectares  (330 acres)  are in municipal  ownership.  Only 5 hectares  (13 acres)  are under  state  ownership  in the  Quincy/Dorchester area  with  20 hectares  (50 acres)  in municipal  ownership. The  Quincy/Dorchester area  is identified  in the  Category  Plan  for Preservation of Black  Duck  Wintering Habitat  Atlantic Coast  by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1988).

Conservation Recommendations: Fee title  acquisition  of remaining  saltmarsh habitat.  Vegetative control  of

Phragmites to restore  saltmarsh habitat.


Inland Rivers, Massachusetts The river systems of Massachusetts provide valuable wildlife habitat as well as a variety  of other important ecosystem functions.  In Massachusetts long history,  most rivers and streams  were dammed  in many places to provide power sources for a variety  of mills. Although  many of these mills are now defunct,  the resulting  mill ponds have succeeded into valuable  wetland  habitat. At the same time, there  is a movement underway  to remove such dams to restore  streams  to their  natural free-ﬂowing state.  The Inland Rivers area is comprised of the Blackstone  River, Nashua  River, and SuAsCo system.  Ownership/Protection varies  greatly  within  the  systems.   The  Great  Meadows NWR  encompasses  1,563 hectares  (3,863 acres)  in the  Sudbury  and  Concord  River systems  and  MassWildlife  owns the  166 hectares  (411 acre)  Pantry Brook WMA which abuts  and drains  into the Sudbury  River.  Pantry Brook is a M.A.R.S.H.  project  site and a low dam  has reclaimed  about  30 hectares  (75 acres)  of deep marsh  habitat that had  previously  succeeded into shrub/scrub wetland.   The  Assabet  NWR  on the  Assabet  portion  of the  SUASCO  system  consists  of 902 hectares  (2,230 acres).  The Oxbow NWR in the Nashua  River watershed  is 674 hectares  (1,667 acres).

Conservation Recommendations: There  is a need to both  acquire  more land  to protect river  corridors  and to institute control  measures  for water  chestnut and purple  loosestrife.

Inner Cape Cod, Massachusetts The Inner Cape Cod Focus Area extends from East Brewster  to North  Truro on the  Cape  Cod Bay side of Cape  Cod and  includes  Wellﬂeet  Harbor.   The  Cape  Cod National  Seashore protects some of the northern portions  of the focus area including the important Great  Island barrier  beach.

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    68

The Inner Cape Cod Focus Area includes 12,030 hectares  (29,729 acres).  There are 936 hectares  (2,313 acres) federally protected as part  of the Cape Cod National  Seashore, 71 hectares  (177 acres) in state  ownership, 182 hectares  (452 acres)  in municipal  ownership,  321 hectares  (794 acres)  protected by nonprofit  organizations (Massachusetts Audubon),  and  37 hectares  (93  acres)  privately protected.   The  southern section  is this barrier  beach is largely in private  ownership.  Massachusetts Audubon  owns a 4,451 hectares  (11,000 acres) sanctuary within  the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Mosquito  control  ditching  is limited  in this  area  of Cape  Cod but  small pockets  of saltmarsh are  ditched  and  should  be restored.    Conservations restrictions on private  property should  be sought.    Restoration of tidal  ﬂow to  the  Herring  River  will result  in increases  tidal  marsh  for waterfowl.

North  and  South  River  Marshes,  Massachusetts The  North  and  South  Rivers  are coastal  estuaries  located in the  towns  of Scituate and  Marshfield,  Massachusetts south  of Boston  and  north  of Plymouth Bay.  The region  consists  of 2,717 hectares  (6,714  acres).    Approximately 607 hectares  (1,500  acres)  are  saltmarsh heavily  infested  with  Phragmites as  one travels  upriver.    The  region  is not  greatly  developed  by  eastern Massachusetts standards.  Only  4.4 hectares  (11 acres)  are in state  ownership.   The  towns  of Scituate and Marshfield own 283 hectares  (700 acres) and 77 hectares  (190 acres) are protected by nonprofit  groups.  The greatest bulk of the area is in private  ownership.

Conservation  Recommendations:  Shoreline  protection through acquisition   of key  tracts and  Phragmites

control.


North  Shore  Marshes,  Massachusetts The  North  Shore  Marshes  are  the  largest  contiguous  saltmarsh  in Massachusetts.  These marshes  extend  27 kilometers  (17 miles) from the  New Hampshire  line to Cape  Ann and  are interlaced  with tidal  ﬂats,  upland  islands,  sounds,  bays and  nine rivers.  The  marsh,  dunes,  barrier beach  and  associated  uplands  spread  over some 14,943 hectares  (36,924 acres)  and  includes  6,474 hectares (16,000 acres) of saltmarsh. The area contains two Black duck wintering concentration sites, one in the mouth of the  Merrimac  River  and  a second south  of Plum  Island  Sound.  The  Plum  Island  area  and  Parker  River National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR)  are popular  tourist destinations for day tripping from spring through fall. This focus area contains  the 2,696 hectares  (6,662 acres) Parker  River NWR and 798 hectares  (1,972 acres) of in state  wildlife management area.  An additional 619 hectares  (1,530 acres)  are also in state  ownership. One hundred  and  eighty  hectares  (446 acres)  are in municipal  ownership  and  2,088 hectares  (5,160 acres) are owned by nonprofit  organizations.  The  remaining  acres are in private  ownership.

ducks winter in Pleasant Bay outside the National  Seashore boundaries. The tidal ﬂats and saltmarsh around Sipson  Meadow  and  Strong  Island  are  among  the  most  important wintering  habitats in  Massachusetts. The  Outer  Cape  Cod  Focus  Area  consists  of 6,799 hectares  (16,801  acres)  of which  599 hectares  (1,482 acres)  are protected by the  Cape  Cod National  Seashore.  The  state  owns only 2.8 hectares  (7 acres),  but municipal  governments own 83 hectares  (206 acres) and nonprofit  agencies, 181 hectares  (448 acres).  There are additionally 41 hectares  (102 acres)  privately protected.

Conservation Recommendations: Acquire conservation restrictions on buffering properties.


Westport Rivers,  Massachusetts The  East  and  West  Branches  of the  Westport River  are  located  in  the southwestern corner  of coastal  Massachusetts, next  to  Rhode  Island.   Westport Point is identified  in the Category  Plan  for Preservation of Black  Duck  Wintering Habitat   Atlantic Coast  by  the  U.S.  Fish  and Wildlife Service (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1988) as an important Black Duck wintering  site.  The total focus area size is 6,221 hectares  (15,371 acres) and contains  400 hectares  (990 acres) of saltmarsh and about
101 hectares  (250) acres of important tidal  ﬂats.  There  is no acreage under  federal protection but  the state owns 210 hectares  (520 acres),  most  of which is the  Horseneck Beach State  Park.   There  is 39 hectares  (97 acres)  in municipal  ownership  and 58 hectares  (145 acres)  protected by nonprofit  organizations.

Conservation Recommendations: Land  acquisition  along the  shore line and  buffering upland  area is recom­

mended.


Connecticut River, Vermont & New Hampshire  The Connecticut River Focus Area is a shared focus area be­ tween Vermont and New Hampshire.  It extends from Third  Connecticut Lake on the New Hampshire/Quebec border  to the Massachusetts state  boundary. The focus area boundaries  extend  5 kilometers  (3 miles) from the  centerline  of the  river  into  both  Vermont and  New Hampshire.   Both  sides of the  river  are punctuated by  numerous  oxbow wetlands,  and  extensive  willow/alder swales,  forested  wetlands,  and  open,  emergent marshes are adjacent to the river throughout much of its length.  These wetlands  provide important breeding and  migratory stopover  habitat several  species of waterfowl  and  other  priority  bird  species.   Much  of the Connecticut Valley is privately owned.  However, many large tracts within and adjacent to the focus area are now either  in conservation ownership  or protected by conservation easements.   The  Vermont portion  of the focus area  includes  5,615 hectares  (13,875 acres)  of state  land,  10,946 hectares  (27,050 acres)  of privately- owned  conservation land,  2,610 hectares  (6,450 acres)  of municipally  owned  land,  and  384 hectares  (950 acres)  of federal  land.   The  focus area  lies entirely  within  the  approved  boundaries  of the  Silvio O. Conte National  Fish  and  Wildlife Refuge (SOC  NFWR). Immediately to  the  west  of the  focus area  in Vermont is the  8,903 hectare  (22,000 acres)  West  Mountain Wildlife Management  Area  (WMA)  and–further west– the  10,521 hectare  (26,000 acres)  Nulhegan  Basin  Division  of the  SOC NFWR.  These  lands  are  part  of a contiguous  53,823 hectare  (133,000 acres)  block of land  formerly  owned by Champion  International Paper


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    70

Company  and now held in easement or fee by conservation entities  (33,993 hectares  or 84,000 acres of which are  on land  owned by Essex  Timber  Company).  Other  large  blocks of conservation land  are  on the  New Hampshire  side of the  river,  including  a 69,403 hectare  (171,500 acres)  conservation easement brokered  by the Trust for Public  Lands,  The Nature  Conservancy  (TNC)  and the State  of New Hampshire,  and another
7,689 hectare  (19,000 acres)  parcel  in conservation easement held  by TNC.  Several  of these  projects  were supported by a 2001 North  American  Wetland Conservation Act grant.

Conservation Recommendations: The  purpose  of the  Silvio O. Conte  National  Fish  and  Wildlife Refuge is to protect the native  diversity  of ﬂora and fauna throughout the Connecticut River Watershed. The actions of the  refuge include  working with all partners within  the  watershed  through a variety  of federal and  state programs  to meet the goals set forth  by the refuge.  These programs,  not limited  to the refuge, include land acquisition,  managing  or regulating public  use, control  of exotic species, dam  removal,  and  other  programs designed to enhance  and conserve the rich natural resources of the Connecticut River Valley.

Great  Bay, New Hampshire  The Great  Bay Focus Area encompasses approximately 110,000 hectares  (271,814 acres) across twenty-four townships in southeastern New Hampshire  surrounding the Great  Bay Estuary. The estuary  has been widely recognized  as one of the  most  important estuarine systems  and  waterfowl  habitat in the  northeastern United  States.   Approximately 1,800 hectares  (4,447 acres)  are tidally  inﬂuenced  with shallow waters,  mud ﬂats,  and extensive  eelgrass beds.  The wetlands  of the focus area are characterized by several subclasses of marine intertidal, estuarine intertidal, riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine wetlands.  The estuary  is characterized by approximately 1,800 hectares  (4,447 acres)  of tidal  waters  with  broad  eelgrass beds and mudﬂats as well as estuarine intertidal-emergent marshes  with smooth  cordgrass  and salt meadow hay.  The uplands  are a transition zone between the deciduous forest to the south and the coniferous forest to the north.  Much of the Great  Bay Focus Area is under private  ownership in relatively small parcels.  However, the  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service owns the  Great  Bay  National  Wildlife Refuge adjacent  to  the  estuary. In addition, a number  of parcels  throughout the  focus area  are under  conservation protection through the efforts of the  Great  Bay Resource  Protection Partnership with  a variety of owners including  the  Audubon Society of New Hampshire,  The  Nature  Conservancy, The  U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, and  local towns. The  Great  Bay  Estuarine Research  Reserve  was established in 1989 and  encompasses  over 4,000 hectares (9,884 acres)  of tidal  waters.   The  reserve  is managed  by the  New Hampshire  Fish  and  Game  Department under  the  Marine  Fisheries  Division.  As of January, 2004, the  Great  Bay Resource  Protection Partnership has conserved  over 2,428 hectares  (6,000 acres)  of wildlife habitat around  the  bay by acquiring  or securing conservation easements  on important properties.

Conservation Recommendations: Partners  with  the  Great  Bay Resource  Protection Partnership have been working  successfully  to  protect priority  parcels  within  the  focus area.   The  Partnership has  put  together a Habitat Protection Plan  outlining  the  priorities  within  the  focus area  and  has  been  diligently  pursuing


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    71
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



plan  objectives  that address  some of the  conservation threats to the  resource.   Conservation of properties, especially those adjacent to other protected areas, is a priority  with the Partnership to help stem development and create  larger patches  of habitat.  Disturbance should be kept  to a minimum  in the higher priority  areas of the estuary  surrounding the eelgrass beds and mudﬂats. Restoration of eelgrass within the estuary  should also be a priority.

Delaware Bayshores,  New Jersey The Delaware Bayshores focus area is one of the most important migratory bird  areas  in the  country. The  marshes  of the  bayshores  winter  over 40,000 Black ducks.  It is a large focus area  located  along the  Delaware  Bay coastline  of New Jersey  extending  roughly  115 kilometers  (71 miles) from the  tip  of Cape  May to the  town of Deepwater, NJ.  It extends  inland  approximately 10-12 kilometers (6-7 miles) encompassing  all the  coastal  wetlands  as well as an upland  buffer.  The  focus area  extends  up the  Maurice  River  approximately 22 kilometers  (13 miles)  to  Millville,  NJ  to  include  important wetland habitats associated  with the river.  The wetlands  associated  with the Delaware are a vast network  of marshes and creeks ranging from high-salinity tidal  saltmarshes to freshwater  emergent and forested wetlands.  Much of the  shoreline  in New Jersey  is under  private  ownership.   However,  the  state  of New Jersey  owns over
16,000 ha within  the  general  Delaware  Bayshores  area.  The  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service owns the  1,100 ha Supawna  Meadows National  Wildlife Refuge as well as Cape May NWR, which maintains several parcels along the Delaware Bayshores.  Other  agencies such as The Nature  Conservancy, New Jersey  Natural Lands Trust, and Cape May County Park  Commission  also maintain holdings for conservation purposes.

Conservation  Recommendations:   Oil  and  chemical  spill  contingency   plans  have  been  approved   for  the Delaware  Bay.   These  plans  should  be kept  current and  periodically  reviewed.   Disturbance to  migratory birds is a critical  threat that should be eliminated. Protection through

fee acquisition  and restoration of wetlands  should be pursued  through state  and federal agencies.


Delaware River Tidal  Freshwater Tributaries, New Jersey The Delaware River Tidal  Freshwater Tributaries Focus Area is one of the most valuable  focus areas in New Jersey.  The focus area is located  in southwestern New Jersey, within the Inner Coastal  Plain physiographic province.  The area encompasses portions  of Salem, Gloucester,  Camden,  Burlington, and Mercer Counties  and is located entirely within the Philadelphia, Penn­ sylvania metropolitan area.  The focus area includes all of the major Delaware River tributaries in New Jersey between Penns  Grove to the south  and Trenton to the north.  The dominant land use is industrial, primarily related  to oil refinery, chemical production, and manufacturing. The area is also heavily residential  given the proximity  to Philadelphia.  In the  southern and  northern portion  of the  focus area,  intensive  agriculture is practiced  with many agricultural fields occurring within 25 meters  (82 feet) of wetlands.  Vegetable  crops are the primary  crops grown although small grains and fruit orchards  are also common.  Despite the high human density,  the majority of the wetlands  in the focus area are productive, tidal,  freshwater  wetlands.  Tidal  wet-

lands are dominated by emergents  including  wild rice, arrow arum,  bur marigold,  spatterdock, smartweeds, rice cutgrass,  and cattails. Invasive  emergents,  including  Phragmites and purple  loosestrife are also present. The majority of the focus area is under private  ownership primarily  for residential, industrial, and agricultural purposes.  Although  the state  lays claim to ownership of all tidal  wetlands  through the New Jersey Wetlands Act of 1970, many individuals  still pay property taxes on marshes that were previously  diked for agricultural purposes.  The New Jersey  Division of Fish and Wildlife has three  small Wildlife Management Areas within the focus area totaling 103 hectares  (254 acres).  Rancocas  State  Park,  managed  by the New Jersey  Division of Parks  and Forestry, totals  507 ha.  The County Park  Commissions of Gloucester,  Camden,  and Mercer also maintain holdings  for conservation purposes.   The  New Jersey  Audubon  Society  owns Monds and  Chester Islands,  which are situated in the  Delaware  River.  The  fertile soils and  strong  agricultural traditions have resulted  in a considerable  amount of holdings in Farmland Preservation easements.

Conservation Recommendations:  Oil and  chemical  spill  contingency  plans  are  in  place  for the  Delaware Bay and River.  These plans should be periodically  reviewed and updated to reduce the likelihood of future spills and improve the eﬃcacy of oil spill response efforts.  The proximity  of the area to Philadelphia places tremendous commercial and residential development pressure  on the few remaining  open spaces.  Protection through fee acquisition,  land  easements,  and  other  cooperative  agreements should  be pursued  through the various  government and non-government agencies.

North  Coast  Complex,  New Jersey  The  North  Coast  Complex  focus area  is comprised  of four  sub-focus areas.   The  Hackensack  Meadowlands/Hudson River  sub-focus  area  is located  in northern New Jersey  in the  lower Hackensack  River  drainage  near  the  northern end of Newark  Bay  with  a small extension  to the lower end of the Hudson  River.  It is the largest  remaining  brackish  wetland  complex in the New York-New Jersey  Harbor  estuary.  The Raritan Bay/Navesink River Sub-Focus  Area is located  in the southern portion of the New York-New Jersey  Harbor  extending  up the Raritan River to Sayreville, New Jersey  and east and south  along the  shoreline approximately 40 kilometers  (24 miles) to the  Navesink  River/Shrewsbury River. This  sub-focus  area  also includes  Sandy  Hook Bay.   The  Neptune  sub-focus  area  includes  the  open  water bay of the  Shark  River  around  Shark  River  Hills and  Neptune  City.   The  Manasquan River  sub-focus area extends  approximately 30 kilometers  (18 miles) up the  Manasquan River  from Manasquan Inlet  to west of Adelphia,  New Jersey.   Generally,  the  wetlands  are  large complexes  of saltwater, brackish,  and  freshwater tidal  emergent  marshes  with  mixed  areas  of mudﬂats, sandﬂats, and  large,  open  bays  fed by many  small tidal  creeks.  Most of the wetlands  within  the focus area have been altered  primarily  for mosquito  and ﬂood control  through ditching,  diking,  and  tidegates.  This  has altered  much  of the  original  diversity,  especially with the  invasion  of common reed.  The  majority of the  land within  the  sub-focus areas  is privately owned. Publicly  owned lands  include  those  managed  by the  New Jersey  Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey  Meadowlands  Commission,  and the U.S. Department of Defense.



USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    73

Conservation Recommendations:  Large  portions  of these  marshes  already  have  been  lost  to  development or alteration of hydrology.   Additional losses could have increasingly  serious consequences.  It is recognized that a practical approach to conservation is needed  in these  areas  of dense human  settlement and  intense development. Further losses of wetlands  through dredging or filling or altered  hydrology  should be curtailed as  much  as  possible.    Development  should  be  re-directed to  areas  that have  been  previously  developed but  are  underused.   The  New  Jersey  Meadowlands  Commission  has  developed  a  draft  Master  Plan  for comprehensive   planning  in  the  Hackensack  Meadowlands.    The  goals  and  recommendations of the  plan should  be implemented to  help  protect and  restore  the  valuable  wetlands  within  this  area.   Discharge  of toxics,  oil, or other  chemical should be monitored  and  reduced  or curtailed completely,  if possible.  Human disturbance also should be held to a minimum  or eliminated  on beaches with active  nesting  colonies.

Northern New Jersey Limestone Valley, New Jersey The Northern New Jersey Limestone Valleys Focus Area contains  some of the most productive and valuable  inland freshwater  wetlands  in New Jersey.  The focus area is located  in northwestern New Jersey  to the southeast of the Kittatinny Mountains encompassing  portions of Warren  and Sussex Counties.  Wetlands in the northeastern section of the focus area drain into the Hudson River Drainage  via the Wallkill River while the remaining  portion  of the focus area drains  into the Delaware River.  The land use is a mosaic of agricultural, residential, and light manufacturing with patches  of forested habitat. Small grain crops, pasture, and hay are the dominant agriculture although there  are notable  areas with dairy farms as well as fruit and vegetable crops.  Focus area wetlands  include limestone fens, ﬂoodplains, spring-fed wetlands,  and a significant portion  of New Jersey’s glacial lakes.  Phragmites and purple loosestrife are common in some wetlands.  The majority of the focus area is privately owned.  The New Jersey  Division of Fish  and  Wildlife  has  seven  Wildlife  Management Areas  within  the  focus area  totaling 4,570 hectares (11,292 acres).   The  New Jersey  Division of Parks  and  Forestry has three  parks  in the  focus area  totaling
3,995 hectares  (9,871 acres).  Wallkill River National  Wildlife Refuge, located  in the northern portion  of the focus area,  is comprised  of 1,883 hectares  (4,652 acres).  The New Jersey  Audubon  Society and The Nature Conservancy  also have  land  holdings.  The  fertile  limestone  valleys and  strong  agricultural traditions have resulted  in a considerable  amount  of holdings  in Farmland Preservation easements.   Kittatinny Mountain, just  west of the focus area,  is predominantly public land.

Conservation Recommendations:  Long-term  planning  for human  population growth  throughout the  focus area is critical to deal with the existing development pressures.  Land protection through fee acquisition,  land exchanges, conservation easements,  cooperative management agreements, purchase  of development rights and comprehensive  planning  are needed to maintain the ecological integrity of focus area wild lands.  Restoration of riparian habitats along some focus area  tributaries could result  in both  improved  habitat and  improved water  quality.  Enhancement of wetlands  that have been dominated by non-native, invasive plants  should be a priority.  Control  of Mute  Swan populations in the most productive wetlands  should be considered.

Passaic River Basin, New Jersey The Passaic River Basin Focus Area is one of the largest freshwater  wetland complexes in the northeastern United  States.  However, the focus area is also located  only 40 kilometers  (25 miles)  from  downtown  New York  in  one  of the  most  heavily  developed  areas  of New Jersey  presenting a  host  of challenges.   Many  of the  major  wetland  areas  are  preserved  in  public  ownership  although the surrounding landscape  is dominated by suburban and urban  development. Several major roads traverse  the focus area.  Focus area wetlands  are predominantly palustrine, deciduous-forest wetlands  followed by scrub- shrub wetlands  and emergent marshes.  Phragmites and purple loosestrife are common in many wetlands,  and locally, can be dominant. Although  the majority of the focus area is privately owned as very small parcels, several large tracts of publicly owned lands are also present.  Great  Swamp National  Wildlife Refuge, located in  the  headwaters of Passaic  River,  is the  largest  single  parcel  at  3,000 hectares  (7,413  acres).    Several municipal  and  county  parks,  including  Lord  Stirling  Park,   Loantaka Brook  Park,   the  Somerset  County Park  and  Environmental Education Center,  Fairmount Park,  and  the  Morris  County Outdoor  Education Center,  are adjacent to the refuge.  The New Jersey  Division of Parks  and Forestry manages  Troy  Meadows and  Great  Piece Meadows Natural Areas  which total  3,000 hectares  (7,413 acres)  along the  Passaic  River ﬂoodplain.   Wildlife Preserves,  Inc.   owns additional sections  of Troy  Meadows.   The  Essex  County Park Commission  manages  West Essex Park,  which is comprised  of about  9 kilometers  (5.5 miles) of undeveloped ﬂoodplain  forest  along the  east  side of the  Passaic  River.  The  New Jersey  American  Water  Company  and Commonwealth Water  Companies  operate  three  drinking  water  reservoirs  on the  east  side of the  Passaic River.  The Jersey  City  Water  Company  operates  Boonton  Reservoir,  along the Rockaway  River.

Conservation Recommendations: Practices for reducing  the impacts  of ﬂooding including  filter strips,  ripar­ ian forest buffers, enhanced  and maintained detention basins,  and conversion of mowed turfgrass  to natural vegetation should be implemented and expanded. Long-term planning for human population growth through­ out the focus area basin is critical to deal with the existing development pressures.  Land protection through fee acquisition,  land  exchanges,  conservation easements,  cooperative  management agreements, purchase  of development rights and comprehensive  planning  are needed to reinstate the ecological integrity of focus area wetlands.  Enhancement of wetlands  that are dominated by non-native, invasive plants  should be a priority.

Pineland Bogs, New Jersey  The  Pineland Bogs focus area  is located  in southern New Jersey  in the  heart of the  New Jersey  Pinelands.   Two  sub-focus  areas  are  recognized,  Burrs  Mill Bogs and  Mullica  River. Wetlands make up about  one-third  of the pinelands  area and are characterized by a diverse range of wetland types including  Atlantic white cedar swamps,  hardwood  swamps,  pitch  pine lowland forests, marshes,  bogs, open water,  and  pine barren  savannas. The  wetlands,  including  bogs, of the  focus area are associated  with lowland areas surrounding the Mullica River and the Burrs Mill and Wading  Rivers.  Generally,  these waters are  of high  quality  supporting abundant communities of fauna  and  ﬂora.   A number  of cranberry bogs, both  active  and  abandoned, are  scattered throughout the  focus area.   Many  of the  abandoned bogs are succeeding  back  into  shrub  swamps  with  leatherleaf  associated  with  highbush  blueberry  and  inkberry  on

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    75

mats  of sphagnum  ((U.S.F.W.S. 1996).  Forested  wetlands  are generally dominated by Atlantic white  cedar or red  maple.   The  National  Parks  and  Recreation Act  of 1978 designated  The  New Jersey  Pinelands as the  countrys  first national reserve.   A comprehensive  management  plan  was written to balance  protection and  development interests throughout the  reserve.   Most of the  pine  barrens  is privately owned,  although private  non-governmental conservation organizations, including The Nature  Conservancy, have ownership in substantial holdings.  However, roughly  one-third  is in public  ownership  (U.S.F.W.S. 1996).  Public  owners include  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  with  E.B.  Forsythe National  Wildlife  Refuge,  Department of Defense with Fort  Dix, McGuire  Air Force Base, and Lakehurst Naval Engineering  Center,  and the state  of New Jersey  with a number  of state  parks  and wildlife management areas.

Conservation Recommendations: Fire maintenance of the  ecosystem  through prescribed  burning  should be a priority  not  only to maintain unique  communities  and  to prevent  catastrophic ecological fires and,  also, to prevent catastrophic residential  damage.  Water  quality  is vital  to the migrant birds that breed,  migrate, and  winter  in the  pine  barrens  and  for those  that use the  important coastal  habitats directly  affected  by the pine barrens.  Activities  associated  with residential  or commercial development, forestry,  and agriculture should be closely monitored  by the appropriate state  and federal agencies for maintenance of water  quality.

South  Atlantic Coast,  New Jersey  The  South  Atlantic Coast  focus area of New Jersey  is a very large focus area extending  approximately 160 kilometers  (99 miles) from Point Pleasant to Cape May.  It extends  inland to encompass important saltwater habitats including emergent saltmarshes and shallow, back barrier  lagoon systems.   Also, the  focus area  extends  up the  Mullica  River  from the  mouth  of Great  Bay,  the  Great  Egg Harbor  River,  Toms River,  and  several smaller tributaries into Little  Egg Harbor  and  Barnegat Bay to the inland  extent of the  tidal  inﬂuence.  The  focus area  is a diversity  of wetland  communities including  barrier beaches,  back-barrier estuaries,  emergent tidal  saltmarshes, sand  and  mudﬂats, islands,  submerged  aquatic vegetation, brackish  and  freshwater  emergent wetlands  and  open water.   The  majority of saltmarsh as well is under  public  ownership.   The  shoreline  and  islands  are  a mix of public  and  private  owners.   Extensive saltmarshes and adjacent uplands  along Barnegat and Brigantine Bays are owned and managed  by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  In addition, the state  of New Jersey owns and manages several wildlife management areas, state  parks, and natural areas within the focus area.  Privately owned lands, especially along the barrier beach, are heavily developed for summer  and weekend homes.  Conservation Recommendations:  Acquisition and protection of these habitats should be a priority.

Finger  Lakes, New York The Finger  Lakes Focus Area is located  in central  New York and encompasses  two of the  eleven Finger  Lakes, Seneca and  Cayuga.   The  focus area  extends  from approximately the  northern tip of Seneca and Cayuga  Lakes to the southern terminus of both  lakes just south  of Ithaca  on Cayuga  Lake and Watkins Glen on Seneca Lake.  The western  boundary extends  as far west as Penn  Yan on the northern terminus of Keuka Lake and tapers  toward  the northern and southern extents  of the focus area.  The eastern


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    76

boundary extends  east  to approximately Venice Center  about  halfway  between  Cayuga  and  Owasco Lake. The  northern tip  of the  focus area  on Cayuga  Lake abuts  the  southern boundary of the  Montezuma Focus Area.   The  landscape  of the  focus area  is dominated by agriculture, especially around  the  lake edges, and forests.  Residential and  industrial development is relatively  sparse  but  concentrated near  the  edges of the lakes.  The  large expanse  of deep,  open water  in Cayuga  and  Seneca Lakes provides  habitat for migrating and wintering  including  black ducks.  The majority of the focus area is under  private  ownership.

Conservation Recommendations: Monitoring  use of the Finger Lakes Focus Area by breeding,  migrating, and wintering  birds  should continue  as well as monitoring of water  quality.   Disturbance to birds  using the  area should  be held to a minimum  during  critical  times  of the  year.  The  importance of this  area  for migrating and wintering  waterfowl is significantly enhanced  by the presence of waste grain (corn, soybeans) in adjacent upland  fields.  Programs that seek to protect farms  and  agriculture as a way of life should  be encouraged and supported.

Hudson  River Valley, New York The  Hudson  River Valley Focus Area stretches approximately 250 kilome­ ters (155 miles) from the tip of Battery Park,  Manhattan to the inland  tidal  extent at Troy  Lock and Dam and  encompasses  35,394 hectares  (87,460 acres).  The  boundary generally  follows the  shoreline  of the  river. Habitats encompassed  by the  focus area include highly saline zones in the lower reaches of the  river transi­ tioning  into  brackish  and  then  to tidal-  freshwater  riverine  and  palustrine emergent and  forested  habitats. The uplands  and shoreline along the Hudson River is a mosaic of public and private  owners.

Conservation Recommendations:  The  Hudson  River  Valley Focus  Area  is under  intense  threat from many different  sources.   A comprehensive  plan  that recognizes the value  of the  aquatic  and  terrestrial  resources of the  river  should  be  undertaken to  better understand the  individual  and  cumulative effects of actions within  the estuary. Actions  undertaken to improve the quality  of the estuary  should consider water  quality improvement, minimizing  the  negative  effects of dredging  and  spoil deposition,  cumulative effects of piers and  platforms,   control  of exotics,  and  the  maintenance and  building  of railroads  and  highways  adjacent to the  river  to maintain the  hydrologic  connection  or restore  connection  to tidal  wetlands.   Currently, the U.S. Army  Corps  of Engineers  is spearheading the  Hudson  River  Estuary Habitat Restoration Project  in partnership with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and Department of State.

Iroquois,  New York The  Iroquois  Focus  Area  is located  in western  New York between  the  cities of Buffalo and  Rochester  and  encompasses  53,524 hectares  (132,259 acres).   The  boundaries of the  focus area  extend from the  eastern  end of Niagara  County near  Wolcottsville  eastward to approximately State  Highway 237. The  north-south boundary extends  from approximately the  town  of Medina  on the  northern end, south  to the  town  of Oakfield,  including  portions  of the  Tonawanda Indian  Reservation.  This  area  of western  New York is dominated by agriculture of medium to high productivity interspersed with many wetlands,  including

several large and diverse wetlands  (T.  Carroll,  unpublished report). Most of the focus area is under  private ownership with public lands held by Iroquois National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR),  owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Oak Orchard and Tonawanda Wildlife Management Areas (WMA),  owned by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Much of the Oak Orchard swamp is under state  or federal ownership.   The  focus area  also includes  sections  of the  Tonawanda Indian  Reservation in the  southwest corner.

Conservation Recommendations:  Disturbance to nesting  and  migrating waterfowl  should  be minimized  or eliminated. The spring migration period is critical for hens to gain the necessary energy reserves for successful nesting.  Control  of purple  loosestrife through beetle releases should continue  to help maintain the diversity and  integrity of the  wetland  systems.   Depending  on the  objectives,  succession of wetlands  and  grasslands should  be controlled  with  proper  water  level management  on wetlands  and  mowing regimes for grasslands as well as early successional management for forests.

Lake Champlain Valley, Vermont/New York The  Lake Champlain Valley Focus  Area  encompasses  155,678 hectares  (384,687 acres)  the  narrow  Lake  Champlain Valley  between  the  Adirondack  Mountains of New York and  the  Green Mountains of Vermont. Historically,  the  valley was dominated by northern hardwoods (Laughlin  and Kibbe 1985).  However, fertile soils and gently  rolling topography made the valley one of the most productive agricultural areas in the northeastern United  States  and one of the first inland  areas to be colonized by Europeans. Currently, agriculture is the dominant land use with only small fragments  of forest remaining;  although, increasing  farm  abandonment  is leading  to  increased  reforestation.  The  wetlands  of the  Lake Champlain Valley form numerous  and  diverse communities.  Much of the  Lake Champlain Valley is in private  ownership.

Conservation Recommendations: Disturbance to breeding  and migrating birds should be minimized or elim­ inated.  Efforts should be made to control  point and non-point source pollution  to improve the water  quality of Lake Champlain. Control  of invasive species is needed to maintain or improve the biodiversity  and habitat quality  of the lake and the associated  wetlands  and uplands.  Also, effort should be made to support and en­ gage the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its mission to coordinate  the development of a comprehensive plan for the Lake Champlain Basin.

Lake Ontario  Islands,  New York The  Lake Ontario  Islands  focus area  is located  within  the  eastern  basin ecosystem  of Lake Ontario.  The  boundaries  run  from Bartlett Point,  New York just  inside  the  mouth  of the St.  Lawrence River south  to Southwick  Beach State  Park.  The boundary extends  from approximately 5 kilometers  (3 miles) inland  west offshore to the Canada-  United  States  border.  The focus area includes the islands  of Carlton, Grenadier, Fox,  Galloo, Little  Galloo, Stony,  and  Calf Islands.   The  focus area  also en­ compasses the important shoals associated  with the islands.  Agricultural fields predominantly pasture, with

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



scattered shrub  and  woodlands  dominate  the  mainland  habitats. Many  of the  farms have been abandoned with fields reverting  to forests.  Ownership  on the mainland  is predominantly private. However, several pub­ lic holdings  of New York Department of Environmental Conservation dot  the  shoreline  including  Ashland Flats  Wildlife Management Area (WMA),  Dexter Marsh WMA, Long Point State  Park,  and Westcott Beach State  Park.   The  islands as well are predominantly privately owned with a few publicly  owned islands such as Gull and Little  Galloo Islands and parts  of Galloo Island.  The U.S. Coast  Guard  maintains ownership of the Galloo Island  lighthouse.

Conservation Recommendations:  Most  conservation efforts in eastern  Lake Ontario  have  been small  scale and  local.   The  increasing  pressure  on this  area  for recreation demands  a more  comprehensive  approach to  conservation to  maintain the  integrity of the  diversity  of habitat types within  the  focus  area.    This includes private  lands needs staging  areas  on nearshore  waters.  Also, monitoring of the long-term  effects of contaminants on physiology and reproduction of migratory birds should continue.

Lake Shore Marshes,  New York The  Lake Shore Marshes  focus area encompasses  a long narrow  strip  along the  southern and  eastern  shores  of Lake Ontario.  The  boundary runs  from approximately Hamlin  Beach State  Park in Monroe County east through Rochester  and Oswego to Southwick Beach State  Park in Jefferson County along the eastern  shore of Lake Ontario. The focus area extends  approximately 3 km offshore. The majority of the  focus area is privately owned.  However, public ownership  is scattered throughout the  focus area  with substantial public  ownership  in the  eastern  Lake Ontario  section  with  much of the  shoreline  and wetlands  owned and managed  by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation as either  state parks or wildlife management areas.  The majority of the uplands  in the focus area are in private  ownership.

Conservation Recommendations:  Development along  the  shoreline  probably  would prohibit acquisition  of large  tracts of land  (NY  DEC  2002).   However,  where  tracts of important wetlands,   dune  systems,  and tributaries exist they  should be protected through fee or easement acquisition  to prevent development, loss of habitat, and  potential disturbance to staging  and  migrating birds.   Also, water  quality  of Lake Ontario should  be improved  through best  management practices  in agricultural areas  and  in residential  areas  by curtailing use of pesticide  and  herbicide  thus  reducing  runoff.   Control  of invasive  plants  is important to maintain the diversity  of wetlands

Long Island  South  Shore Complex,  New York This area encompasses  79,094 hectares  (195,447 acres).  This system extends  in an east-west direction  for 145 kilometers  (90 miles) along the south  shore of Long Island, from Coney Island in New York City east to Southampton at the eastern  end of Shinnecock Bay.  The shallow water  wetlands  and  back-barrier areas  are highly productive, especially the  saltmarshes and  mudﬂats that fringe the barrier  islands and the estuarine habitats around  the creek outlets.  The deeper water habitats are composed  of sandy  shoals and  eelgrass beds that provide  cover and  nursery  habitat to many  species.  The


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    79
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



ownership  pattern along the  south  shore of Long Island  is variable  including  federal,  tribal,  state,  county, and  town.   However,  most  of the  shoreline  is privately owned and  developed  for residences,  marinas,  and marine-related industries.

Conservation Recommendations: Disturbances to wintering  black ducks needs to be minimized or eliminated entirely.  The single most important factor to preserve the aquatic  habitats is controlling  waste and nonpoint source pollution  entering  the estuary  to protect the bay fishery and maintain habitat quality.  Efforts should be made to designate  the bay as a ”no discharge  zone” for sewage from recreational boating.  Dredging  new boat  channels  should be avoided and alterations to the inlet should be minimal  to preserve the present tidal pattern.

Montezuma,  New  York  The  Montezuma  Focus  Area  is one  of the  largest  and  most important wetland complexes in the  northeastern United  States  encompassing  65,229 hectares  (161,183 acres).  The focus area is located in central  New York in Wayne,  Seneca, and Cayuga  Counties  about  halfway between Syracuse and Rochester.  The boundary of the focus area generally follows the 118 meter  (390 foot) contour  encompassing a diversity  of habitat types around  the  wetland  complex.  The  dominant land  use is agriculture with  corn, potatoes, onions, beans, and wheat  or hay as the major crops.  Purple  loosestrife, Phragmites, pale swallow- wort  and  white  water  lily are prevalent in the  wetlands.   Globally  significant inland  saltmarshes are found within the focus area as well as non-vegetated mudﬂats (Ducks Unlimited  2000). Rural homesteads and small communities make up most of the developed land, which is a minor component of the land use.  The majority of the focus area is under  private  ownership dominated by dairy farms and muck farms.  Public  ownership is within the Montezuma National  Wildlife Refuge, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Northern Montezuma Wildlife Management  Area,  New York Department  of Environmental Conservation.  In addition, the  New York Department of Transportation owns significant acreage along the Seneca River/Barge Canal (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1991) with much of these lands under  Management Agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.

Conservation Recommendations:Restoration of marginal  or abandoned farmlands,  both wetland  and upland, should be pursued  where possible and  followed with long-term  management (S. Hess, personal  communica­ tion).  Agricultural runoff and potential leaching of harmful  pollution  from the landfill should be monitored. Water  quality  within  the impoundments (i.e.  Seneca River/Barge Canal)  should be monitored  for pollution from agricultural practices  as well as the  quality  and  integrity of restored  mucklands.   Public  education is an  important component of long-term  management for the  Montezuma wetlands  complex  and  should  be fostered to increase public awareness  about  the critical  role this area plays in the annual  cycle of migratory birds.  Controlled access on the federal and state  lands should continue  to limit the number  of people using the  area  at  any  one time  to minimize  disturbance to migrating  black  ducks  and  maintain the  value  of the complex.  Purple  loosestrife control  should continue  with control  of other  invasive species.

Niagara  River/Buffalo Harbor,  New York The Niagara  River/Buffalo Harbor  Focus Area extends  the length of the Niagara  River corridor  connecting  Lakes Erie and Ontario  on the United  States  side only.  It includes Grand  Island and extends approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) offshore from Buffalo Harbor in the southern reaches of the focus area.  It is a significant migration and wintering  area for waterfowl including black ducks. The  natural communities of the  Niagara  River  corridor  have  been severely degraded  through a variety  of human  disturbances. Most of the wetlands  have been lost due to filling, contamination, dewatering  through river diversion,  and invasion  of exotic plants  such as purple  loosestife.  Some of these degraded  wetlands  are within  or adjacent to publicly  held parkland while others  are adjacent to developed commercial  lands.  The majority of the land along the river corridor is privately owned by municipal,  corporate, or private  interests. However,  a number  of state  parks  and  national historic  sites  are  scattered along  the  corridor.   The  area has significant cultural resources related  to the history  of the United  States  with the National  Park  Service maintaining three  National  Historic Landmarks along the river.  Also, portions  of the corridor  are owned by the  New York State  Department of Parks,  Recreation, and  Historic  Preservation and  the  New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

Conservation Recommendations: Although  toxic contamination from PCBs  and  dioxins have been reduced and continue  to be addressed,  these contaminants represent a long-term  threat to the integrity of the health of all wildlife using  the  focus area.   Contaminants in the  Niagara  River  should  continue  to  be monitored with increased efforts to reduce the inﬂux of long-term  and injurious chemicals.  The remaining  wetlands  and shallow-water  habitats should be protected and  restored  for use by black ducks and  other  migratory birds. Tourist-related disturbance should be eliminated  or reduced  to a minimum.

Oneida Lake, New York The Oneida Lake Focus Area encompasses Oneida Lake and portions  of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal  to Ilion, New York and includes 121,150 hectares  (299,366 acres).  The southern boundary extends  to  Syracuse,  New York  and  runs  east  approximately along  the  New York  State  Thruway (I-90) where the  eastern  boundary tapers  to its terminus in Ilion, New York.  The  southern portion  of the  focus area includes the large Cicero Swamp area.  Because of the productive wetland  soils, agriculture is a dominant land  use and  has  resulted  in the  substantial loss of wetlands.   Most  of the  agriculture is dairy  farms  with vegetable,  sheep, beef, and equine farming  comprising  the  remaining  non-dairy  farming  operations. Loss of some farming operations has resulted  in many  restoration opportunities within  the focus area.  The eastern portion  of the  focus area  follows the  Mohawk  River/Erie Canal  for approximately 60 kilometers  from the eastern  shoreline  of Oneida  Lake.  The  majority of the  ownership  within  the  focus area  is private  either  in residential  or agriculture. Many seasonal homes are located  along the shoreline of the lake, especially along the southern shore, which is the most heavily developed area of Madison County.  The New York Department of Environmental Conservation, and  the  Department  of Parks,  Recreation, and  Historic  Preservation own and  maintain several  Wildlife  Management Areas,  State  Parks,  and  State  Forests  within  the  focus area. Commercial  and  industrial ownership  is based  around  the  cities  and  villages and  makes  up  a very  small

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    81

percentage  of the ownership  pattern.


Conservation Recommendations:  Monitoring  the  spread  and  potential direct  and  indirect  effects of exotic species, especially zebra mussels, should be a priority  for this focus area.  Disturbance from shoreline devel­ opment and recreational boating  should be held to a minimum.  Wetlands should be protected and restored, where opportunities exist, to provide  habitat for black ducks and other  wildlife species.

Peconic Bay Marshes, New York The Peconic Estuary is composed of diverse communities distributed among a series of interconnected bays between  the  north  and  south  forks of eastern  Long Island  and  encompasses
43,873 hectares  (108,412 acres).   The  wetland  habitats within  the  Peconic  Estuary are  diverse  including emergent and rocky intertidal, freshwater, and brackish  wetlands,  mudﬂats, beaches and dunes,  and beds of submerged  aquatic  vegetation such as eelgrass and wigeongrass.  Much of the land surrounding the estuary  is held in private  ownership.  Approximately 60% is either  in open space/recreational, agriculture, or is vacant; however, most of these lands are vulnerable  to development (Suffolk County 1991, Suffolk County 1999). The remaining  40% is under  residential, industrial, or commercial  development.  The  Peconic  Estuary Program as developed  a Comprehensive  Conservation and  Management Plan  that details  strategies to  protect the valuable  resources  of eastern  Long Island  and  the  estuary  (Suffolk County  1999).  The  state  of New York owns several state  parks  on the  extreme  eastern  end of both  the  north  and  south  forks.  The  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service own several small refuges located  within  the Peconic Estuary.

Conservation Recommendations: Protecting the integrity of the Peconic Estuary is critical  to many  species of migratory birds and  other  wildlife.  The  Suffolk County Department of Health  Services prepared a Com­ prehensive  Conservation Management Plan  (Suffolk County 1999) for the  Peconic  Estuary to  address  the conservation needs  and  outline  the  necessary  strategies to  protect the  estuary  in the  face of the  rapidly changing  surrounding landscape.  The Peconic Estuary Plan  makes a number  recommendations to conserve the integrity of the estuary. Some of these include reduce and restrict shoreline hardening, reduce non-point source  pollution,  and  pursue  acquisition  of undeveloped  parcels.   Refer  to  the  Peconic  Estuary Program: Comprehensive  Conservation Management Plan  (1999) for a complete  list of recommendations.

St.   Lawrence  Plain,  New York  The  St.   Lawrence  Plain  is a mosaic  of diverse  habitat types  supporting a broad  array  of waterfowl  and  non-waterfowl  species.   The  landscape  of the  focus area  is dominated by agriculture with  croplands,  hay  fields, and  pasture (Wells  2000).  The  area  encompasses  713,871 hectares (1,764,006  acres).    This  agricultural landscape  is interspersed with  numerous  forested,  scrub-shrub, and emergent wetlands.   A unique  feature  of the  focus area  is the  presence  of sheetwater wetlands  (Northern Ecological  Associates  1994).  Most  of the  St.   Lawrence  Plain  is held  in relatively  small  private  holdings. However,  numerous   Wildlife  Management  Areas,  State   Parks,   and  other  state-owned lands  are  located throughout the  focus area.   The  New York State  Power  Authority operates  the  St.  Lawrence/Franklin  D.


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    82

Roosevelt  Hydroelectric  Facility  in conjunction with  the  Province  of Ontario.  The  Power  Authority has created  a number  of parks  primarily  on the St.  Lawrence River within  the towns of Waddington, Massena, Lisbon,  and  Louisville  (Woodlot  Alternatives, Inc.   1999, New York  Power  Authority 2002).   The  largest federal landowner  is the U.S. Army at Fort  Drum.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service own the St.  Lawrence Wetlands and  Grasslands Management District, a  small  parcel  of less than  202 hectares  (500  acres)  of grassland  habitat.  In addition, the  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service owns over 404 hectares  (1,000 acres)  of Farmers Home Administration transfer  properties  and numerous  easements,  primarily  wetlands.

Conservation Recommendations:The primary  conservation concern  is keeping  agricultural grasslands  from succeeding into shrublands and eventually  to forests.  The Farm Bill sponsors many programs that could assist farmers keep their land agricultural, thus maintaining habitat for grassland  species, and restore and maintain important wetlands.    Some  of these  programs  include  the  Conservation Reserve  Enhancement Program, Wildlife Habitat Incentives  Program, and  Wetlands Reserve  Program.  The  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service have  developed  the  Landowner  Incentives  Program that could be used to help manage  private  grasslands, shrublands, and  forest  patches  for priority  species.  Pollution from agricultural and  industrial runoff needs to be monitored  and reduced  or eliminated  where it poses a threat to the health  of priority  habitats.

Carolina  Bays, North  Carolina  The Carolina  Bays Focus Area encompasses  approximately 170,842 hectares (422,159 acres) in southeastern North  Carolina  and includes portions  of Bladen,  Cumberland, and Sampson Counties.  This area of the coastal  plain is characterized by numerous  depressional  wetlands  called Carolina Bays.  Hundreds  of these depressions  occur in the focus area,  and many  have been drained  or altered.  Some of the bays are filled by lakes while others  support densely shrubby  pocosin communities. A few, like Bushy Lake in southeastern Cumberland County, have both  open water  and  pocosin communities.  The  bay  rims support longleaf pine communities, and intervening ﬂats support a mix of upland  longleaf pine and wetland pocosin communities. Extensive  ﬂoodplain swamp habitat is also present in this focus area, with brownwater communities along Cape  Fear  River,  which originates  in the  Piedmont, and  blackwater communities along the streams  and rivers originating in the Coastal  Plain.  Many of the Carolina  Bays are intact and do provide habitat for waterfowl  and  other  wetland-associated species.  Additionally, many  can be restored  to provide similar  habitat.  Much  of the  surrounding upland  landscape  is dominated by southern pine forests.   These areas were historically  important wintering and migration habitat black duck.  Land in this region is primarily privately owned, followed by various  properties  under  stewardship of the  State  of North  Carolina.   Uplands are dominated by industrial forest  interests and  agriculture, interspersed with  ridges of longleaf pine.  The relatively  low number  of landowners  in the  region has helped  retain  the  natural qualities  of the  region and limit  development.  Opportunities  exist  to restore  drained  and  altered  Carolina  Bays,  and  to restore  large areas to longleaf pine.

Conservation Recommendations:  Major  conservation actions  here are restoration of the  natural hydrology


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    83

of Carolina  Bays, and protection of extensive bays and remaining  wetlands.  Major recommendations for this focus area are to limit development through conservation easements,  and to provide incentives to landowners to protect and restore  the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem.

Currituck Sound/North River,  North  Carolina  The  dominant feature  of the  Currituck Sound   North  River Focus  area  is the  fresh and  brackish  water  wetlands  of the  Currituck Sound.  The  Northwest River,  which drains  into  the  upper  portion  of Currituck Sound,  and  the  North  River  along  the  western  edge  of the focus area,  are the  other  major  waterbodies  included.   The  focus area  is located  in Camden  and  Currituck counties  and  encompasses  94,914 hectares  (234,538 acres).   The  western  edge of the  area  is composed  of forested  wetlands  adjacent  to  the  North  River  while the  eastern  edge is bordered  by the  Atlantic Ocean. Land use is a mixture  of agricultural interests, corporate and private  woodlots, and residential  development. Notwithstanding the Currituck Sound and other waterbodies  which are considered public waters, the majority of the  focus area  is under  private  ownership  with  a  mixture  of small  woodlots,  farming,  and  residential development.   Public  ownership  occurs  primarily   with  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (USFWS)   at the Mackay Island and Currituck National  Wildlife Refuges and with the North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) at the North River Game Land and the Northwest River Marsh Game Land.  Number of hectares  under  ownership  by these  entities  exceeds 10,000 hectares  (24,711 acres).   Number  of hectares under  private  ownership  and with conservation easements  approaches 1,000 hectares

(2,471 acres)  and includes 600 hectares  (1,482 acres) of the Pine Island  Audubon  Sanctuary.


Conservation Recommendations:Due to the tremendous increase in land value in the last decade, acquisition of habitat in Currituck County (especially adjacent to Currituck Sound) will be diﬃcult and costly.  However, conservation organizations should continue to look for and pursue key parcels of land for acquisition and/or for conservation easement.  Annual  or periodic monitoring of SAVs in Currituck Sound has not been conducted in the  past,  but  efforts are now underway  to acquire  consistent  funding  sources and  to develop  a strategy for long-term  SAV monitoring. This  should continue  to be a high priority  for all natural resource  agencies and  organizations.   To  offset  long-term  losses of SAV,  restoration of prior-converted wetlands  into  high quality  managed  areas  should  receive high  priority.  The  most  likely locations  for land  acquisition  where habitat development and restoration can be accomplished  will be in the intensively  farmed areas of northern Currituck County and Camden  County.  The North  Carolina  Partners and/or similar programs  (CRP, CREP and  WHIP)  that are a cooperative  effort between  natural resources  agencies and  private  landowner  should be encouraged  and promoted in the area.

Falls/Jordan Lakes, North  Carolina  The Falls   Jordan Lakes Focus Area encompasses  portions  of Chatham, Durham, Granville,  Lee, Orange,  and  Wake  Counties  in the  Piedmont  of North  Carolina.   The  focus area is 302,120 hectares  (746,556 acres)  in size. The  notable  wetland  feature  is the  presence of Falls and  Jordan


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    84
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



Lakes, and Harris Reservoir.  Both Falls and Jordan Lakes are managed  by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for ﬂood control,  water supply, and recreation. Harris Reservoir was constructed to serve the Shearon Harris nuclear  power plant.   As mitigation for the  loss of wetland/waterfowl habitat when both  Falls  and  Jordan Lakes  were created,  a series of green-tree  reservoirs  were created  at  Jordan Lake  while a combination of green-tree  reservoirs and moist-soil type impoundments were constructed near Falls Lake.  In addition  to the lakes and  managed  areas,  the  relatively  narrow  hardwood  ﬂoodplain  fringing  the  numerous  tributaries to each of the lakes is the other primary  wetland  feature.  The majority of the focus area is in private  ownership; however, several large public landholdings include both  Butner-Falls of Neuse 16,700 hectares  (41,266 acres) and  Jordan 17,300 hectares  (42,749 acres)  Game  Lands.   A large  portion  of these  game  lands  are  owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  and managed  by the North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission. Two state  parks,  Eno River and William B. Umstead  account for an additional 3,200 hectares  (7,907 acres) in the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Conservation organizations should  continue  to  look for opportunities to protect the remaining  fringe of bottomlands along the lakes and tributaries. Admittedly, acquisition  will be diﬃcult as land prices are very high in this area.  One purpose for the creation of this focus area is to recognize the important contribution the existing green-tree  reservoirs and managed  moist soil impoundments provide to  waterfowl  in the  area.   Opportunities do exist  for the  creation  of additional managed  wetland  habitat on areas  already  owned by public  entities  and  for enhancement of existing  areas.  These  options  should  be pursued.

Lower Cape Fear River, North Carolina The Lower Cape Fear River Focus Area encompasses 117,840 hectares (291,189 acres) in Bladen,  Pender,  Brunswick,  and New Hanover  Counties,  with smaller portions  occupying Columbus and Sampson Counties.  This focus area extends southeastward along the Cape Fear River from the Carolina  Bays Focus Area eventually  reaching  the ocean.  This portion  of the Cape Fear  River is navigable, and  as the  river nears the  ocean, it becomes a slow moving coastal  river,  and  eventually  becomes a coastal estuary  below Wilmington, North  Carolina.  This portion  of the Cape Fear  River is a brownwater river that is tidally  inﬂuenced  well inland  upstream of New Hanover  County.

Conservation Recommendations: Protection of the  aquatic  habitat in Cape  Fear  River  and  its tributaries is diﬃcult  because  it is affected by activities  throughout the  watershed.  These  include  industrial eﬄuents, agricultural runoff, and  municipal  treatment facility  outfall.   Some sources of pollution  can be reduced  by careful control  of sedimentation and storm  water  runoff.  A buffer zone of vegetated, undisturbed soil along river  banks  is also beneficial.   Cape  Fear  River  should  be regularly  monitored  to  gauge  impacts  to  water quality  over  time.    The  following conservation actions  have  been  identified  in  this  region:   acquire  land and conservation easements,  promote  private  lands management compatible with conservation goals for the targeted communities, restore groundwater hydrology,  reduce and mitigate  impacts  associated  with livestock

wastes,  and reduce and mitigate  impacts  from incompatible forestry  practices.


Lower Pee Dee River, North Carolina The Lower Pee Dee River Focus Area is located in Anson, Montgomery, Richmond and Anson Stanly counties, encompassing 81,389 hectares  (201,115 acres) along the Pee Dee River, including  Blewett  Falls Lake.  The Pee Dee River begins in North  Carolina  on the eastern  escarpment of the Southern  Appalachians near  the  Tennessee  and  Virginia  boundaries.  Several  significant wetland  habitats such as oxbow lakes, beaver  ponds  and  vernal  ponds  occur in the  ﬂoodplain  forests  of the  Great  Pee Dee River.  These wetlands  provide key habitat for many wetland-dependant species, including black ducks, other waterfowl  and  many  other  wetland-  associated  birds.   Ownership  in this  focus area  is primarily  in private holdings, although the Pee Dee National  Wildlife Refuge and Uwharrie  National  Forest are both  located  in this focus area.  Property owned by Progress  Energy Carolinas  and managed  by the North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission  as the Pee Dee River Game Lands (North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission) is also located  in this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Conservation organizations should  continue  to  look for opportunities to protect, through acquisition  or easement,  property which will complement and  enhance  both  the  aesthetic and natural qualities  of the river.  The North  Carolina  Partner’s and/or similar programs  (CRP, CREP  and WHIP)  that are  a cooperative  effort between  natural resources  agencies  and  private  landowner  should  be encouraged  and promoted in the area.

Lumber River, North Carolina The Lumber River is a winding blackwater river that originates in the Sandhills region of North  Carolina  then  ﬂows freely through the  southern coastal  plain  and  into  the  Pee  Dee River in South  Carolina.  The Lumber  River Focus Area encompasses  81,386 hectares  (201,112 acres) primarily  in Robeson County with smaller portions  in Bladen,  Columbus,  and Cumberland Counties.  Ownership  in this focus area is primarily  in private  holdings, the exception  being the Lumber

River State Park  encompassing  3,212 hectares  (7,937 acres).


Conservation Recommendations: The  Lumber  River  is the  only blackwater type stream  with  the  wild and scenic designation  in North  Carolina.  Conservation organizations should continue  to look for opportunities to protect, through acquisition  or easement,  property which will complement and  enhance  both  the  ascetic and natural qualities  of the river.  The North  Carolina  Partner’s and/or similar programs  (CRP, CREP  and WHIP)  that are  a cooperative  effort between  natural resources  agencies  and  private  landowner  should  be encouraged  and promoted in the area.

Neuse/Pamlico Rivers, North Carolina The Neuse  Pamlico Rivers Focus area is the largest in North Carolina, encompassing  498,000 hectares  (1,230,607  acres)  and  representing a  variety  of wetland  habitats.    Along the  Pamlico/Tar River,  the  focus area  reaches  upstream from near  Greenville  downstream to the  Pamlico

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    86

Rivers conﬂuence with the Pamlico  Sound.  Likewise, the Neuse River reaches upstream from Fort  Barnwell downstream to  it’s  conﬂuence  with  the  Pamlico  Sound.    Also included  in  the  focus area  are  the  Pungo River  and  the  complex of naturally formed  lakes found in the  Croatan National  Forest.   The  focus area  is located  in portions  of Beaufort,   Carteret, Craven,  Hyde,  Jones,  and  Pamlico  Counties.    The  majority of the  focus area  is under  private  ownership  with  a mixture  of agricultural land,  large holdings  of corporate timberland and  smaller,  individually-owned woodlots.   Ownership  of those  lands  with  either  conservation protection or natural resource  management emphasis  is quite  varied.  Area  under  protection from the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the North Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission approaches 10,000 hectares (24,711 acres)  and  includes  the  Cedar  Island  National  Wildlife Refuge and  the  Goose Creek Game  Lands. Approximately half of the 65,000 hectares  (160,621 acres) Croatan National  Forest  is in the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations: Conservation efforts should focus on providing  additional protection along portions  of both rivers where development potential is greatest. Best Management Practices relating  to land use/water quality  issues should  be strengthened and  promoted within  the  area.   The  presence  of brackish water  marsh  impoundments is a feature  unique  to  this  area  and  provides  critical  habitat for a variety  of wetland  dependent species.  Continued availability and management of these areas is a high priority.  Annual or periodic  monitoring of SAVs in both  rivers and  Pamlico  Sound  has not  been conducted  in the  past,  but efforts are now underway  to acquire consistent funding sources and to develop a strategy for long-term  SAV monitoring.  This  should continue  to be a high priority  for all natural resource  agencies and  organizations. The  North  Carolina  Partner’s and/or similar  programs  (CRP, CREP  and  WHIP)  that are  a cooperative effort between  natural resources agencies and private  landowner  should be encouraged  and promoted  in the area.

New River,  North  Carolina  The  New River  Focus  area  is located  entirely  within  Onslow County and  en­ compasses 85,420 hectares  (211,078 acres).  It includes  the  New River  and  its tributaries from Jacksonville downstream where it  empties  into  the  Atlantic Ocean.   Much  of the  Camp  Lejeune  Marine  Corps  Base is located  within  the focus area.  The New River found within  this focus area should not be confused with the New River  located  in the  northwestern portion  of North  Carolina.   A variety  of wetland  habitats exist and include estuarine open water,  estuarine emergent marsh,  pocosin, and isolated  forested wetlands.  A number of green-tree  reservoirs  as well as a 31 hectares  (76 acres)  brackish  water  impoundments is located  within Camp Lejeune and managed  specifically for waterfowl.  Land use in the focus area is varied.  Part of the area may be considered urban/suburban as it includes the city of Jacksonville  (population 66,000) and the Camp Lejeune infrastructure while much of the area is generally rural  with land use being associated  with Marine Corps  activities.  The  majority of the  focus area  is under  public  ownership  with  the  Camp  Lejeune Marine Corps  Base the  primary  landholder. The  Stones  Creek Game  Land,  1,015 hectares  (2,508 acres)  is located within  the focus area and is managed  by the North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission.

Conservation Recommendations:  To ensure  continued availability of preferred  waterfowl  foods, Best  Man­ agement  Practices relating  to  land  use/water quality  issues should  be strengthened and  promoted within the  area.  Conservation efforts should focus on providing  additional protection along the  New River and its tributaries where  development  potential is greatest.  Distribution and  quantity of SAV in the  New River is unknown.    At a  minimum,   an  initial  investigation of SAV  with  future  periodic  monitoring should  be considered.

Northern Albermarle, North  Carolina  The  Northern Albemarle  Focus Area is characterized by three  fresh­ water  river  systems  (Perquimans, Little,  and  Pasquotank) whose drainage  originates  from  the  expansive Great  Dismal  Swamp.   The  area  includes  nearly  all of the  Albemarle  Sound  (except  the  extreme  western portion). The focus area is located in northeastern North  Carolina  and includes all or portions  of the follow­ ing counties:  Camden,  Chowan,  Currituck, Gates,  Pasquotank, and  Perquimans.  Over  the  last  200 years, much  of the  area  has been ditched,  drained  and  converted  to agricultural cropland.   The  primary  land  use is agricultural. Forested  wetlands  adjacent to the river systems  are the dominant wetland  type. Submerged aquatic  vegetation (SAV) can be found in the  lower reaches  of each of the  river systems  and  also along the Albemarle  Sound shoreline.  Trends  in SAV coverage are unknown,  but  anecdotal information suggests that coverage  has  increased  in recent years.   This  development is encouraging  in that overall  SAV coverage  in coastal  habitats has  declined  over the  long-term.   The  majority of the  focus area  is under  private  owner­ ship dominated by farms  and  private  woodlots.  Public  ownership  occurs primarily  with  the  U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service (USFWS),  North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources  Commission  (NCWRC) and  North  Carolina State  Parks.  Number  of acres under  ownership by these three entities  exceeds 20,600 hectares  (50,904 acres) with  over 14,000 hectares  (34,595 acres)  occurring  at  the  Great  Dismal  Swamp  National  Wildlife Refuge and  adjacent Dismal  Swamp  State  Natural Area  in the  extreme  northern portion  of the  area.   Additional property under  conservation easement accounts  for an additional 375 hectares  (926 acres) while Department of Transportation mitigation sites exceeds 364 hectares  (900 acres).

Conservation Recommendations:  With  the  exception  of the  Dismal  Swamp  complex,  habitat conservation (acquisition, restoration, and enhancement) activities  by public entities  have been minimal.  Protection of the remaining swamp (through acquisition  or easement) adjacent to the lower portions of each of the river systems should be a high priority.  However, protection will be diﬃcult  as much of the land is very expensive; prices having  increased  dramatically in recent years due to the explosion in housing development. In recent years, conservation organizations have acquired  thousand of acres of wetland  habitats in eastern  North  Carolina. The  areas  primarily  consist  of marsh  habitat and/or large contiguous  blocks of semi-permanently ﬂooded swamp.  Because of the undevelopable nature of these areas,  cost/acre is relatively  small.  As an alternative, public  and  private   conservation entities  should  consider  acquisition  or  easement of land  that is under  a higher threat of residential  or industrial development. Because these  areas  are generally characterized by a relatively  small wetland  fringe bordered  by uplands,  cost/acre will be much greater  than  those areas  which

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    88

cannot  be developed  due  to  existing  environmental regulations.  The  conservation of these  areas  will not only protect wetlands  but  will also have  greater  water  quality  benefits  than  the  acquisition  of those  areas already  having  de facto protection. Restoration of prior-converted wetlands  in the  area has great  potential especially  at  those  sites  where  agricultural production is marginal  due  to  poor  drainage  conditions.   The North  Carolina  Partner’s and/or similar  programs  (CRP, CREP  and  WHIP)  that are a cooperative  effort between  natural resources agencies and private  landowner  should be encouraged  and promoted in the area.

Pamlico/Albermarle Peninsula, North  Carolina  The Pamlico-Albemarle Focus Area can be characterized as a large peninsula  with Albemarle Sound to the north,  Pamlico Sound to the south and Croatan Sound to the east.  This region is also been designated  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the second largest estuarine system  in the  United  States  with  nationally significant aquatic  and  wetland  resources.  Alligator River is the major river drainage  system in the area with the Scuppernong River, Little  Alligator  River and the Pungo River representing secondary natural drainage  systems.  Inland  four large lakes dot the landscape. Mattamuskeet Lake, the  largest  natural lake in North  Carolina,  covers 15,600 hectares  (38,548 acres).  It is a freshwater  lake averaging  only 0.6 meters  (1.9 feet) in depth.  More than  half of the lake bottom is covered by submerged  aquatic  vegetation (SAV). The dominant SAVs are wild celery, redhead  grass, southern naiad, and muskgrass.  The focus area is located  in northeastern North  Carolina  and includes all or portions  of the following counties:   Washington, Beaufort,  Tyrrell,  Hyde and  Dare.   Over  the  last  100 years,  much  of the area has been ditched,  drained  and converted  to agricultural cropland.  The primary  land use is agricultural. Forested  wetlands  adjacent  to  the  river  systems  are  the  dominant  wetland  type.   A large  percent  of the area  is under  federal  and  state  ownership  (approximately 186,000 hectares  or 459,614 acres)  comprised  of Alligator  River National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR),  Mattamuskeet NWR,  Swanquarter NWR,  Pocosin  Lakes NWR,  the  Departments of the  Navy  and  the  Air Force,  and  State  Gamelands (Alligtor  River,  J.  Morgan Futch, Buckridge,  Gull Rock, Pungo  River,  Long Shoal,  New Lake and  Lantern Acres).  The  remainder of the focus area is under  private  ownership  dominated by farms, nonriverine  swamps and pocosin habitat.

Conservation Recommendations: In recent years, conservation organizations have acquired thousand of acres of wetland  habitats in eastern  North  Carolina,  especially  within  the  Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula Focus Area.  These  areas  primarily  consisted  of marsh  habitat, pocosin habitat and/or large contiguous  blocks of semi-permanently ﬂooded swamp.  Because of the undevelopable nature of these areas, cost/acre is relatively small.  As an alternative, public and private  conservation entities  should consider acquisition  or easement of land  that is under  a higher  threat of residential  or industrial development. With  the  increase  in the  wood products industry for hardwood  species and improved logging practice  (i.e.  shovel-logging), the protection of the  remaining  nonriverine  swamp  (through acquisition  or easement) should be a high priority.   In addition, the  restoration of prior-converted wetlands  in the  area  has  great  potential especially  at  those  sites  where agricultural production is marginal  due to poor drainage  conditions.

Roanoke/Chowan Rivers,  North  Carolina  The  Roanoke-Chowan Rivers  Focus  Area  includes  the  Roanoke River basin which is recognized as one of the largest  intact bottomland hardwood  systems  remaining  in the Mid-Atlantic region.  The focus area is located in northeastern North  Carolina  and includes all or portions  of the  following counties:  Bertie,  Chowan,  Gates,  Halifax,  Hertford,  Martin,  Northampton, and  Washington. The boundary roughly follows the drainage  of the Roanoke and Chowan  Rivers in North  Carolina.  Forested wetlands  adjacent to the  Roanoke  and  Chowan  Rivers  as well as their  major  tributaries (Cashie,  Meherrin and  Wiccacon)  are  the  dominant wetland  type.  The  range  expansion  of beaver  into  this  area  has  greatly increased this habitat type in the last 20 years.  The river systems are generally characterized by natural river levees transitioning into  bottomland ﬂats  that either  grade  into  large interior  back swamps  or into  a ridge and  swale system  found adjacent to the  river levee.  Increases  in submerged  aquatic  vegetation (SAV) have been noted  in recent years in the western  portion  of the Albemarle  Sound (at  the conﬂuence of the Chowan and Roanoke Rivers).  This development is encouraging  in that overall SAV coverage in coastal  habitats has declined over the long-term.  The focus area encompasses 590,098 hectares  (1,458,159 acres) and includes only four towns of approximately 5,000 and one town of approximately 17,000. The majority  of the focus area is under private  ownership dominated by farms, private  woodlots and corporate timberlands. Public ownership occurs primarily  with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)/Roanoke River National  Wildlife Refuge and the North  Carolina  Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC). Number  of hectares  under ownership by the  USFWS  and NCWRC  exceeds 15,000 hectares  (37,066 acres).  Management agreements of various  time lengths exist with other public (N.C. Division of Parks  and Recreation) and private  landowners  (The Nature Conservancy) and account for approximately 12,950 hectares  (32,000 acres) under current protection. Other significant public ownership  is by the  North  Carolina  Department of Corrections which operates  two farms encompassing  approximately 3,600 hectares  (8,895 acres)  and  Merchants Millpond  State  Park  485 hectares (1,200 acres).

Conservation Recommendations: Conservation activities  in the past  have largely centered on the acquisition of intact tracts of back  swamp  and  hardwood  ridges  adjacent to  the  river  systems.   This  should  continue where opportunities exist with the goal of establishing  a large wildlife corridor stretching from the Albemarle- Pamlico  peninsula  through the  upper  portion  of the  Roanoke  and  Chowan  River  basins  in Virginia.   The decline in the quality  and the unpredictable nature of wetland  habitat due to the asynchronous and untimely ﬂooding regime along the Roanoke River calls for more intensive wetland  creation,  restoration, and enhance­ ment activities  than  what  has typically occurred  in the past.  The goal of this activity  is to provide  a stable habitat base available  each year for migratory waterfowl.  The ability  to intensively  manage  the large tracts of back swamp will be diﬃcult,  but  opportunities do exist.  This effort will require  a close working relation­ ship with  those  entities  managing  water  ﬂows and  with  other  state  and  federal organizations including  the North  Carolina  Division of Water  Quality,  North  Carolina  Division of Marine  Fisheries  and the Army Corp

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    90

of Engineers.   Restoration of marginal  or abandoned farmlands, both  prior-converted wetland  and  upland, should be actively pursued  where possible and followed with long-term  management. Recent efforts through the  cooperative  North  Carolina  Partners program  have restored  over 34 hectares  (85 acres)  of wetlands  on private  lands and should continue.

Southern  Outer  Banks,  North  Carolina  The  Southern  Outer  Banks  Focus  Area  can be characterized as a barrier  island  complex with  the  Croatan, Pamlico  and  Core Sounds  to the  west and  the  Atlantic Ocean  to the east.  This region can be divided into four distinct habitat zones: beach, shrub-scrub, maritime  forest and marsh.  Of these zones, the marsh  and adjacent Sound waters  are most important to waterfowl,  particularly black ducks..  This focus area contains  the most extensive area of submerged  aquatic  vegetation (SAV) in the state.   Eighty percent (80%) of the SAV is in southern and eastern  Pamlico  Sound.  Lesser areas  occur west of Bogue Inlet,  in western  Pamlico  Sound,  Croatan Sound,  and  Roanoke  Sound.  The  focus area  is located in eastern-most North  Carolina  (i.e.   Outer  Banks)  and  includes  all or portions  of the  following counties: Dare,  Hyde and  Carteret.  A large percentage  of the  area  is in private  ownership.   The  remaining  portion is under  federal and  state  ownership  approximately 26,400 hectares  (65,235 acres)  and  is comprised  of Pea Island  National  Wildlife Refuge,  Cape  Hatteras National  Seashore,  Cape  Lookout  National  Seashore,  and Roanoke  Marshes  Gameland.

Conservation Recommendations:  Environmental planning  will be essential  to conserve and  protect the  re­ gion’s water  quality  and  natural communities. The  need  is to  balance  economic growth  on the  Southern Outer  Banks with the need to secure the environmental future  is the greatest conservation challenge for this focus area.

Upper Neuse River, North  Caronlin  The Upper Neuse River Focus Area encompasses Johnston County in its entirety and a portion  of Wayne County in east central  North  Carolina  and comprises approximately 222,218 hectares  (549,111 acres).  This  focus area is largely comprised  of a complex of lakes, rivers,  and  tributaries, with  extensive  riparian areas  between  Goldsboro  and  Raleigh.   Much  of the  upland  area  is forested  or in agriculture. Ownership  in this focus area is largely privately-owned.

Conservation Recommendations: Some recommendations for this focus area are to acquire land and conser­ vation  easements,  reduce and mitigate  impacts  associated  with livestock and other  agricultural wastes,  and reduce and mitigate  impacts  from incompatible forestry  practices.

Waccamaw  River, North Caronlina The Waccamaw  River Focus Area encompasses 183,979 hectares  (454,622 acres)  in  Brunswick,   Bladen,   and  Columbus  counties.    This  area  includes  the  upper  Waccamaw   River, a portion  of Green  Swamp,  and  Lake Waccamaw.  The  Waccamaw  River  is classified as a blackwater river system.  The Waccamaw  River is unique in that it is the only river originating from a Carolina  Bay, beginning at  Lake  Waccamaw  in Columbus  County,  North  Carolina.    The  Waccamaw  River  has  a large,  relatively

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    91

unbroken  riverine bottomland hardwood  ecosystem Land in this region is primarily  privately owned, followed by various  properties under  stewardship of the  State  of North  Carolina,  including  Lake Waccamaw  State Park,  and  The  Nature  Conservancy. Uplands  are dominated by some of the  best  examples  of longleaf pine forests  and  savanna  communities remaining  in the  southeastern United  States.   The  relatively  low number of landowners  in the region has helped retain  the natural qualities  of the region and limit development.

Conservation Recommendations:  Major  conservation actions  here are restoration of the  natural hydrology of Carolina  Bays, and  protection of extensive  swamps  and  remaining  bottomland hardwood  forests.  Major recommendations for this focus area are to limit development through conservation easements,  and to provide incentives  to landowners  to protect and restore  the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem.  .

Cussewago Bottoms, Pennsylvania Cussewago Bottoms lies within  the  glaciated  Pittsburgh plateau section of the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province and is within the Lower Great  Lakes/St. Lawrence Plain Bird  Conservation Region (BCR  13).  Cussewago  Creek  is within  the  French  Creek  watershed  and  its  as­ sociated  bottomlands and  uplands  comprise  about  5,260 hectares  (13,000 acres)  in north  central  Crawford County.    Cussewago  Creek  is a  low gradient  stream   subject  to  frequent  ﬂooding.    This  creates  numer­ ous seasonally  ﬂooded wetlands  and  pasturelands within  the  ﬂoodplain.   Much  of the  site  is composed  of bottomland-hardwood forest and scrub/shrub wetlands,  with smaller acreages of emergent wetlands.  Mean­ ders within  the creek, oxbows and beaver  dams have created many  high quality  wetlands  for waterfowl  and other  wetland  dependent wildlife.  Most  of the  area  is in private  ownership  with  land  use being composed primarily  of agriculture, forest  uses and  rural  housing.   State  Game  Lands  269 is a 267-hectare  (660 acre) tract owned and managed  by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.  It is composed of a large wetland  complex with a small impoundment and adjacent uplands.

Conservation Recommendations:  Efforts  to  protect existing  lands  within  the  Bottoms from  development should be undertaken through acquisition  and conservation easement or through local land use zoning laws. Conservation practices  should be implemented on farmland  through  the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and  other  USDA, NRCS  and  State  programs.   Monitoring  and  control  of invasive  plant species such as purple  loosestrife, common reed and reed canary  grass should be undertaken.

Delaware River Basin, Pennsylvania The Delaware River is the longest free-ﬂowing river in the eastern  United States.  The Delaware River Basin Planning Area encompasses 749,943 hectares (1,853,142 acres) and includes the entire  non-tidal  Pennsylvania portion  of the Delaware (Morrisville and north), as well as the eastern  half of the  Pennsylvania portion  of the  rivers  drainage  basin.   The  western  half of the  basin  is not  included  in the  Planning Area because  of its lower value to waterfowl  due to the  presence of more intensive  urban  and agricultural land use as well as some more mountainous areas.  Approximately 15-20% of the northern portion of the  planning  area  is in public  ownership  (Pennsylvania Game Commission,  Pennsylvania Department of


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    92

Conservation and Natural Resources, and National  Park  Service), including a substantial portion  of the large intact wetland  complexes in the Pike County Focus Area.  In addition, much of Long Pond  Swamp is secure under  the ownership  of The Nature  Conservancy. Several water  authorities, timber  companies,  and hunting clubs  control  large  unfragmented parcels,  while remaining  private  lands  include  residential  developments, lower-density residential  areas,  and some farmland. South  of the  Kittatinny Ridge, public landholdings  are limited  to a few small, isolated  state  game lands  (Quakertown Swamp is included  in SGL 139) and  state  / county parks  surrounded by privately owned farmland  and residential  developments.

Conservation Recommendations:  There  is an  urgent need  throughout the  planning  area  for coordinated municipal  and  regional  planning  to  ensure  that ongoing  development is conducted  in an  environmentally sensitive  manner.   Waterfowl  habitat partners should  work with  local authorities and  developers  to ensure the  protection of existing  wetlands  (including  preventing the  conversion  of emergent  wetlands  to  open- water  habitats), the  maintenance of adequate connectivity and  upland  buffers to  minimize  the  effects of disturbance and non-point pollution,  and the preservation of agricultural lands as feeding areas for migrating and  wintering  waterfowl.  Carefully  targeted acquisitions  and  easements  will be important tools in securing the most vulnerable  high-quality wetland  systems.

Wetland restoration and  enhancement  on both  public  and  private  lands  should  also be a high priority  in this  planning  area.   In agricultural areas,  these  efforts should  be linked  to  the  Pennsylvania Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program and other  Farm  Bill programs  that promote  expansion  of perennial  nesting cover.  Technical  assistance  should be provided  to lake associations  and  other  private  landowners  who wish to restore  or enhance  waterfowl habitat on recreational lakes and other  wetlands.  Where possible, especially on public  lands,  recreational use should be managed  through use of restricted-entry propagation areas  and other  means  to  minimize  disturbance to  breeding  waterfowl.   Increased  control  efforts for invasive  species would result in marked  habitat improvements in many  areas.

Lower Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania The Lower Susquehanna River Planning Area (LSRPA) is contained within  the  Ridge  and  Valley and  Piedmont physiographic provinces  and  extends  from Sunbury  down  the Susquehanna River  to  the  Maryland state  line  and  includes  many  tributary creeks  and  reservoirs.    The planning  area  encompasses  2,100,206 hectares  (5,189,701  acres).    The  Susquehanna River  corridor  is an important migratory pathway for migratory birds  bound  for the  Chesapeake  Bay.   The  LSRPA  and  its productive shallow waters,  lakes, islands, wetlands,  gravel bars and mudﬂats provide  important feeding and resting  habitat for waterfowl.  Less than  5% of the total  acreage of the LSRPA  is in public ownership.  Many of the river islands within the LSRSPA are owned and managed  by Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC), Pennsylvania Deptartement of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR)  or public utilities.  Many islands in the LSRPA  are managed  specifically for waterfowl  and are designated  refuges by the PGC.

Conservation Recommendations:  Efforts  should  continue  and  be expanded  to  prevent the  loss and  degra­ dation  of wetland  habitat in support of the  goals of the  Chesapeake  Bay  2000 agreement (Environmental Protection Agency, 2000) and Chesapeake  Bay Executive  Order (Department of the Interior  2010). Nutrient reduction and wetland  restoration efforts should be expanded  to improve water  quality  and wetland  habitat for waterfowl.   Enrollment of private  farmlands  in the  Conservation Reserve  and  Enhancement Program (CREP) should  be encouraged  to  provide  benefits  to  water  quality  and  upland  nesting  habitat.   Refuge areas should be acquired  to provide disturbance free habitat to breeding,  migrating and wintering  waterfowl. Acquisition,  restoration and enhancement of wetland  habitats within the LSRPA  should be actively pursued and funding sources secured for these programs.

Middle Creek, Pennsylvania The Middle Creek Focus Area is located within piedmont physiographic province and is also within  Bird Conservation Region 29. Middle Creek provides  important wintering  and migration habitat for migratory birds,  especially  waterfowl.   The  Middle  Creek  Wildlife Management Area  (WMA) contains  a 161-hectare  (400-acre)  impoundment along with  smaller  shallow water  wetlands  and  moist  soil areas managed  for waterfowl and other  wetland  birds.  The surrounding privately owned lands are primarily agricultural, and provide waste grain and forage for ducks, geese and swans during spring and fall migration. The  2,509-hectare   (6,200-acre)  Middle  Creek  WMA  is managed  for  wildlife  by  the  Pennsylvania  Game Commission.    The  remaining  lands  in  the  focus  area  are  in  private   ownership  with  land  use  composed primarily  of agriculture, rural  residential  and small residential  communities.

Conservation Recommendations: There  is an urgent need to develop land use planning  efforts to protect the remaining  open space and  farmland  surrounding the  Middle  Creek  WMA.  Conservation easements  should be acquired  and where possible acquisition  of key areas should be a priority.  Enrollment of private  farmland in the  Conservation Reserve and  Enhancement Program (CREP) should be encouraged  to provide  benefits to water  quality  and upland  nesting  habitat. Acquisition,  restoration and enhancement of wetland  habitats within the focus area should be actively pursued  and funding sources secured for these programs.  Monitoring and control  of invasive plant and animal  species should be expanded.

Northwest Planning  Area,  Pennsylvania The  Northwest Planning  Area  lies  within  the  Glaciated Pitts­ burgh Plateau Section of the Appalachian Plateau Physiographic province and encompasses 120,041 hectares (296,628 acres).  The  river valley from Jamestown to Greenville  is privately owned.  Below Greenville,  most of the river ﬂoodplain,  including Shenango Lake is largely in public ownership through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  and has a forested buffer along most of the length.  The Moraine  portion  of the Planning Area is under  public ownership  through the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

Conservation Recommendations:  Water  levels in the  Shenango  River  are  now regulated  by  releases  from

Pymatuning Reservoir,  which help feed municipal  water  supplies downstream and  maintain water  levels in



USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    94

the  Beaver  River  (Coxe  2003).   Along with  the  imperatives given these  uses,  the  maintenance of natural communities and  ecological systems  need to be taken  into  consideration with the  release of water  from the reservoir.  The requirements of these natural systems  will need to be better researched  and evaluated.

Activities  upstream in the watershed  need to be evaluated for their impact  in increasing nutrients and runoff ﬂowing into the Shenango River Focus Area (Coxe 2003). Efforts to decrease the non-point pollution  through streambank fencing programs  and  upgrades  to sewage treatment plants  would be key to reducing  nutrient loads in the river.  Substantial and contiguous  riparian buffers (forest and shrubland) would not only assist in reducing  non-point source pollution  but  also add  to natural habitat within  stream  valleys.  Invasive  species need to be monitored  along the length  of the river and efforts taken  to prevent their  spread  to other  parts  of the river.  Landowner(s) should be made aware of the significance of what they own and be given information on how to manage  for the  plants,  animals  and habitats present here.  It may be possible for groups like the Shenango  Conservancy  or the  Shenango  River  Watchers to help in educating landowners  and  users of the corridor  as to the significance of the habitats and requirements of the animals  and plants  of special concern. Increasing the amount of forested riparian areas along the Shenango River would encourage the development of more viable natural communities, both  instream and out.  Intact woodlands  are also better able to resist invasive  species, which are prevalent along the  river.  Monitoring  of invasive  species would help in tracking their  spread  and ultimately in control  efforts.

Wetland restoration and enhancement activities  should be implemented on private  lands within the Planning Area,  to  provide  quality  habitat for waterfowl  and  other  wetland  dependent  wildlife.  Landowners  should also be encouraged  to participate in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) for the Ohio River basin,  which will improve water  quality  and provide  upland  nesting  cover for breeding  waterfowl.

Careful  planning  within  the  Planning Area  and  the  Shenango  River  Focus  Area  would  benefit  both  the ecological resources  and  people living on the  land.   Recognizing  the  river  and  surrounding landscape,  as a prime  ecological and  recreational resource  may  be an  initial  step  in this  planning  (Coxe  2003).  The  U.S. Army  Corps  of Engineers,  the  many  private  landowners  and  the  municipalities included  in the  focus area should  come together  to consider  comprehensive  planning.   Resources  available  through the  county,  state, and federal governments such as agency management plans, Rivers Conservation Plans,  and other  initiatives may help in defining issues and providing  some guidance in developing community-based conservation plans.

Ohio  River  Valley,  West  Virginia  This  planning  area  consists  of the  islands  of the  Ohio  River,  the  back channels  and  riverine  habitats associated  with  these  islands,  and  adjacent wetland,  embayment and  bot­ tomland  habitat within  the  Ohio River  ﬂoodplain  in West  Virginia  (WV),  and  the  Ohio River  Focus  Area in Pennsylvania.  In WV,  the  planning  and  focus area  spans  450 kilometers  (280 miles) of the  Ohio River corridor  and includes 401,714 hectares  (992,653 acres).  In Pennsylvania, the focus area incorporates 58,462


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    95

hectares  (144,462 acres).   Most  of the  habitats within  this  area  have  been classified as Resource  Category I under  the  United  States  Fish  and  Wildlife Mitigation Policy.  These  areas,  particularly the  islands,  back channels,  and embayments, have long been recognized by state,  federal, and private  organizations as having high quality  fish and  wildlife, recreational, scientific and  natural heritage  value.  The  majority of the  Ohio River  ﬂoodplain  area  is privately owned.  The  Ohio River  Islands  National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR),  estab­ lished in 1990, protects 22 islands and 3 mainland  tracts totaling approximately 1,416 hectares  (3,500 acres) of ﬂoodplain habitats. A total  of 30 islands are targeted for acquisition  or protection, and over 809 hectares (2,000 acres) of embayments and wetlands  in West  Virginia are identified  for protection. The West  Virginia Division of Natural Resource  owns over 404 hectares  (1,000 acres)  of lands  and  open water  along the  Ohio River at Green Bottom  Wetland Management Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Restoration of ﬂoodplain  wetlands  previously  altered  by agriculture; con­ servation  easements  or acquisition  of embayments and other  important riparian habitats; continued  acquisi­ tion of islands; reduction of non-point source pollution  loading which affects aquatic  bed habitat; minimiza­ tion of dredging  and spoil disposal in productive wetland  habitats.

Pike County, Pennsylvania The  Pike County Waterfowl  Focus  Area  lies within  the  Glaciated Low Plateau Section  of the  Appalachian Plateau physiographic province  and  is within  the  Appalachian Mountains Bird Conservation  Region  (BCR  28)  and  the  Delaware  River  Basin  Waterfowl  Planning Area.    Pike  County has  been  identified  as a waterfowl  focus area  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin  Planning Area  because  of its especially high concentration of exceptional  quality  wetlands;  Pike  County is the  most  heavily  forested portion  of the wetland-rich glaciated  region of Pennsylvania, and therefore  the premier  area in the state for those avian  species that thrive  in this combination of habitats. The focus area includes all but  the extreme northern and  western  portions  of Pike  County (which  contain  fewer wetlands  and  less public  land);  it  is bordered  on the northeast and southeast by the Delaware River, on the northwest by the Lackawaxen  River, and  on the  southwest by  the  higher  elevations  of the  Pocono  Plateau.  The  focus area  consists  of about
12,140 hectares  (30,000 acres) of freshwater  wetlands  within a forested (primarily deciduous)  habitat matrix of approximately 121,400 hectares  (300,000 acres).  Wetland types present are diverse and often interspersed. They  include  bogs, slow-moving streams,  beaver  ponds,  emergent  marshes,  shallow lakes, and  scrub-shrub and  forested  swamps.  The  forested  matrix  is a vital  accompaniment to these  wetlands  because  it provides a buffer zone that helps maintain wetland  water  quality,  reduce  human  disturbance, and  provide  breeding habitat for cavity  nesting  species.

Approximately 35% of the land within the focus area is in public ownership (Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and  Natural Resources,  and  National   Park  Service).    Several additional large, unfragmented parcels are controlled  by private  hunting clubs.  Other  private  lands include large second home developments in primarily  forested settings,  lower density  residential areas, and numerous

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



small tracts of privately owned forestland.


Conservation Recommendations: The most urgent conservation need in the focus area is coordinated planning to ensure that ongoing development is conducted  in an environmentally sensitive manner.  Waterfowl  habitat partners should  work with  local authorities and  developers  to  ensure  the  protection of existing  wetlands (including  preventing the  conversion  of emergent wetlands  to open-water  habitats) and  the  maintenance of adequate connectivity and upland  buffers to minimize the effects of nest predation, human  disturbance, and non-point pollution.   Carefully  targeted acquisitions  and  easements  will be important tools in securing  the most vulnerable  high-quality wetland  systems.  Technical  assistance  should be provided to hunting clubs, lake associations,  and other  landowners  who wish to enhance  waterfowl habitat on their  properties. Recreational use should be managed  to minimize  disturbance to waterfowl,  especially during  critical  nesting  and  brood- rearing  periods  in spring  and  early summer,  through use of restricted-entry propagation areas,  educational materials, and  other  means.   For  invasive  species,  monitoring efforts  should  be  increased  and  aggressive prevention and control  measures  implemented to address  incipient threats while they remain  at manageable levels.

Presque  Isle, Pennsylvania Presque  Isle is a narrow  sand spit of land extending  into Lake Erie.  It lies within the  Eastern Lake  Section  of the  Central Lowland  physiographic province  and  is within  the  Lower Great Lakes/St.  Lawrence  Plain  Bird  Conservation Region  (BCR).  Presque  Isle contains  about  1,294 hectares (3,200 acres)  of deciduous  woodlands,  freshwater  wetlands  and  lakeshore  habitat. There  are approximately
185 hectares  (458 acres)  of freshwater  wetlands.   All 1,294 hectares  (3,200) acres of Presque  Isle are owned by the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as Presque  Isle State  Park  (PISP) and  managed  by the  Pennsylva­ nia Department of Conservation and  Natural Resources.   Gull  point,  the  eastern  tip  of the  peninsula  was designated  a migratory bird sanctuary in 1927.

Conservation Recommendations:  Efforts  should  continue  to manage  and  reduce  human  disturbance to mi­ grating  and  nesting  birds.    Aggressive  control  of invasive  plant and  animal  species  on  PISP   should  be implemented.  Research  into  understanding the  relationship of botulism  to zebra  mussels,  and  round  goby and the effects of selenium and other  contaminants on waterfowl  and waterbird population is needed.

Pymatuning, Pennsylvania The Pymatuning Focus Area lies within  the glaciated  Pittsburgh plateau section of the  Appalachian Plateau  physiographic province  and  is within  the  Lower  Great  Lakes/St.   Lawrence Plain  Bird  Conservation Region  (BCR  13).   The  Pymatuning-Hartstown wetland  complex  (Pymatuning- Hartstown) and  Conneaut Outlet wetlands  (Conneaut Outlet) are located  within  the  Shenango  River  and French  Creek Watersheds, respectively.  Pymatuning-Hartstown comprises  12,132 hectares  (29,978 acres) in a diverse, horseshoe-shaped wetland  complex (Tautin 2004a).  Pymatuning State  Park  encompasses  most of the  lower 8,304 hectares  (20,442 acres)  and  is mainly  open water  with  upland  buffer for public  recreation


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    97

(boating, fishing,  swimming,  camping,  etc.)    although 356 hectares  (886  acre)  of Blackjack  Swamp  and Clark Island have been designated  a natural area.  The upper portion  of Pymatuning-Hartstown is separated from the  lower portion  by a causeway  dam.   Much  of Pymatuning and  immediate  buffer areas  are  under State  jurisdiction and  thus  afforded a significant measure  of protection.  The  Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources manages Pymatuning State  Park.  The Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) owns and manages  2,164 hectares  (5,391 acres)  of State  Game Lands  (SGL) 214 and 1,664 hectares (4,145 acres) of Pymatuning State  Park  land through lease agreement. Conneaut Outlet  is managed  as SGL
213 by the PGC,  while adjoining  buffer lands remain  in private  ownership.


Conservation Recommendations: Monitoring  and control of invasive plant species such as purple  loosestrife, common  reed,  mutliﬂora  rose and  reed  canary  grass  should  be maintained and/or intensified.   Continued management  of wetlands  through periodic  wetland  draw-downs  and  use  of aquatic   vegetation cutter to maintain habitat diversity  and productivity. Maintain and enhance  existing grasslands  and early succession habitats.  Replace  old or non-functioning water  control  structures to improve  wetland  management oppor­ tunities. Acquire a high volume water  pump  to improve water  management capabilities. Acquire important adjoining  buffer habitats as opportunities arise.  Wetland restoration and  enhancement activities  should be implemented on private  lands  within  the  Focus  Area,  to  provide  quality  habitat for waterfowl  and  other wetland  dependent wildlife.  Landowners  should  also be encouraged  to participate in the  Conservation Re­ serve Enhancement Program (CREP) for the Ohio River basin, which will improve water quality  and provide upland  nesting  cover for breeding  waterfowl.  Continue wildlife nest structure programs.

Shenango  River  Valley,  Pennsylvania The  Shenango  River  Vallely  Focus  Area  lies within  the  Glaciated Pittsburgh Plateau Section of the Appalachian Plateau Physiographic province and Bird Conservation Region (BCR)  Lower Great  Lakes/St. Lawrence Plain #13. The Shenango River represents the main watershed  and the  Focus Area encompasses  approximately 4,775 hectares  (11,800 acres).  The  Shenango  River Focus Area includes the  Shenango  River and  Shenango  Reservoir  from Jamestown Borough  to the  city of Sharon.  The Shenango  River  Valley Focus Area supports a variety  of land  uses, including  crop fields, pastures, quarries and  recently  timbered forest  and  contributes to  habitat discontinuities along  this  riparian corridor  (Coxe
2003). The river valley from Jamestown to Greenville is privately owned.  Below Greenville, most of the river ﬂoodplain, including Shenango Lake is largely in public ownership through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has a forested buffer along most of the length.  The Pennsylvania Game Commission leases and manages
1,255 hectares  (3,100 acres)  of Shenango  Lake and buffer lands for wildlife, principally  migratory birds.


Conservation Recommendations:  Water  levels in the  Shenango  River  are  now regulated  by  releases  from Pymatuning Reservoir,  which help feed municipal  water  supplies downstream and  maintain water  levels in the  Beaver  River  (Coxe  2003).   Along with  the  imperatives given these  uses,  the  maintenance of natural communities and  ecological systems  need to be taken  into  consideration with the  release of water  from the

Susquehanna River,  Pennsylvania The  Susquehanna River  drains  27,500 square  miles in New York,  Penn­ sylvania,  and Maryland. It provides half of the freshwater  input  to the Chesapeake  Bay and is an important migration corridor for many avian species, particularly black ducks that winter on the Chesapeake  and along the mid-Atlantic Coast.  The Pennsylvania portion  of the Susquehanna River Waterfowl  Focus Area includes approximately 300 river  miles of the  North  Branch  and  main  stem  Susquehanna River,  from Sayre  to the Maryland line, along with all adjacent uplands.   A small portion  of the  West  Branch,  just  above its conﬂu­ ence with the North  Branch  at Sunbury, is also included.  Throughout its length,  the river is wide, shallow,


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                    99
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



and  slow-moving,  with  numerous  islands,  gravel bars,  and  mudﬂats.  Over  95% of the  uplands  adjacent  to the  Susquehanna River are in private  ownership.  However, many  islands within  the  river are owned by the Pennsylvania Game Commission  (PGC), Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and  Natural Resources (DCNR),  or public utilities,  with several of the  PGC-owned islands managed  specifically for waterfowl  and designated  as refuge areas.

Conservation Recommendations:  Necessary  improvements in water  quality  cannot  be achieved  within  the focus area  alone,  but  will require  coordinated efforts  throughout the  Susquehanna River  watershed  (e.g., Upper and Lower Susquehanna River Waterfowl  Planning Areas) to both increase filtering capacity   through protection and  restoration of wetlands,  bottomland forest,  and  other  vegetated riparian buffers adjacent to the Susquehanna and its tributaries  and reduce pollutant sources  through improved  wastewater treatment, stabilization of erodible  land,  and  education of resource  users.  Many  of these  actions  are doubly  beneficial to waterfowl  because  they  improve  local feeding and  nesting  habitat as well as downstream / Chesapeake Bay  water  quality.   For  example,  the  Conservation Reserve  Enhancement Program (CREP) retires  highly erodible  cropland  from production, both  reducing  sediment  loads  and  providing  nesting  habitat.  Funding and technical  assistance  to implement this and other  Farm  Bill conservation programs  should be expanded.

On existing public lands within the focus area, human  disturbance should continue  to be carefully regulated, and  further  reduced  where necessary.   Acquisition  of additional key concentration points  for breeding,  mi­ grating,  and wintering  waterfowl,  and areas with high potential for waterfowl habitat restoration, should be pursued.  Monitoring  and control  efforts for invasive species should be increased  on both  public and private lands.

Upper  Susquehanna River,  Pennsylvania Most  of this  planning  area  is part  of the  Glaciated Low Plateau Section of the Appalachian Plateau Physiographic Province  and is characterized by a rolling landscape  that historically  contained an abundance of small natural swamps,  bogs, beaver  ponds,  and  marshes.   Many  of these wetlands  remain,  but many others have been drained  for agricultural production or converted  to lower- quality  open water  habitats (farm  ponds,  recreational lakes, etc.).   The  area  encompasses  727,624 hectares (1,797,991 acres).  Overall,  approximately two-thirds of the planning  area is forested,  but with the exception of some more mountainous sections  in the  western  portion,  agricultural lands  are  extensively  interspersed throughout.  The  only  large  lakes  in the  focus area  are  the  three  ﬂood control  reservoirs  comprising  the Tioga-Cowanesque region.  The  Susquehanna River  Focus Area includes the  entire  Pennsylvania portion  of the North  Branch  of the Susquehanna River focus area below Sayre, the lower portion  of the West  Branch, and  adjacent  uplands.    Both  branches  are  generally  wide,  shallow,  and  slow-moving.   The  upper  reaches of the  North  Branch  ﬂow through the  Glaciated Low Plateau, while the  West  Branch  and  lower reaches of the  North  Branch  ﬂow through the  Ridge and  Valley Physiographic Province,  where there  is a greater preponderance of agricultural, industrial, and  urban  land use.  Overall,  only about  5% of the  planning  area


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  100

is in public  ownership  (predominantly state  forest,  state  game lands,  and  state  parks),  and  many  of these parcels are concentrated in the more heavily forested mountainous areas with lower wetland  densities.  Two areas are notable  exceptions:  a 56 hectares  (140 acres) portion  of Marsh Creek is owned and managed  by the Pennsylvania Game Commission as State  Game Lands 313, and Tioga, Hammond, and Cowanesque Lakes in the Tioga-Cowanesque region are owned and managed  by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The majority of the  planning  and  focus areas  are in private  ownership  as small family farms,  woodlots,  and  low-density residential  areas,  with some urbanized  / industrial areas along the Susquehanna River.

Conservation Recommendations: Wetland restoration and  enhancement on private  lands  should  be a high priority  in this focus area.  The benefits of these efforts can be compounded  by linking them to the enrollment of marginal  farmland  into the Pennsylvania Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, which has recently been expanded  into  this  area  and  can be expected  to  benefit  breeding  waterfowl  through improved  water quality  and expanded  upland  nesting  cover.  Acquisition  of high-quality wetland  complexes, especially those known to support breeding  black duck, should also be pursued  to secure such areas while lands in the focus and  planning  areas  remain  relatively  affordable.  In the  Susquehanna River Focus Area , bottomland forest and  other  vegetated riparian buffers  adjacent to  the  Susquehanna River  should  be  maintained and  / or restored  to  enhance  water  quality  and  provide  feeding and  nesting  habitat.  It  should  be recognized  that wetland  conservation actions  in this focus area provide  not only local benefits,  but  have a positive  effect on important waterfowl  / wetland  habitats downstream, including  the Chesapeake  Bay.

100 Acre Cover/Warren-Palmer Rivers,  Rhode  Island  The  Hundred-Acre Cove and  Warren-Palmer Rivers

Focus Area is a large area located  in the  northeastern portion  of Narragansett Bay, Rhode  Island  (latitude

41o 43, longitude  71o 17) and  encompasses  1,058 hectares  (2,614 acres).   This  area  includes  the  wetlands generally  associated  with  cove and  the  Palmer  River  including  Belcher  Cove  and  extending  into  Bristol County, Massachusetts. This estuarine wetland  system ﬂows in a southerly  direction  into Narragansett Bay. Extending from Narragansett Bay towards  Bristol County, a transition occurs from salt to freshwater  marsh habitats located adjacent to the river channels.  A major feature  of the marshes found here is the presence of four large permanent non-tidal  ponds.  Three  of the ponds are on the Tongue,  the fourth  is on the mainland and  is unique  due  to  the  presence  of a wide band  of saltmarsh which  surrounds the  pond.   The  Palmer River  marshes  are high quality  and  are largely unditched.  The  majority of the  focus area  is under  private ownership.   However, several small (¡ 2 hectares/5 acres)  tracts of land  in Barrington, and  located  directly adjacent to the Palmer  River, are protected by organizations such as the Audubon  Society of Rhode Island and  local land  trusts. In addition, Rhode  Island  Department of Environmental Management owns a small portion  of mainly  saltmarsh habitat located  within  Hundred-Acre Cove.  The  total  area  protected by all of these  tracts is comparatively small ( 40 hectares/100 acres)  relative  to the overall size of the focus area.  In addition, the locations  of the protected land is largely scattered along the river corridor.

Conservation Recommendations: Recommendations include the purchase  of surrounding upland  habitat and wetlands  associated  with the Hundred-Acre Cove and the Warren-Palmer River.  Upland  acquisition  should be extensive  enough  to  serve as an  adequate buffer from visual  and  aural  disturbance as well as physical disturbance.  Controlled access may  be necessary  depending  on the  accessibility  of protected lands.   Land acquisition  should be considered  in pursued  along

the  entire  extent of the  Palmer  River,  including  the  headwaters located  in Massachusetts.  This  will insure that the integrity of this wetland  system is not compromised by upstream pollution.  Finally,  invasive species, particularly Phragmites have encroached  along the fringe saltmarsh and degraded  the habitat quality  in these areas.  A management plan should be developed and implemented to restore  and enhance the habitat quality provide  in these areas.

Arnold  Neck and  Hamilton  Cove, Rhode  Island  Located  on the  west side of Narragansett Bay are Arnold Neck Cove and  Hamilton  Cove.  These  coves are  similar  in habitat type and  waterfowl  use; therefore,  are discussed  together  in this  description. Arnold  Neck Saltmarshis located  along the  east  side of Amtrak Rail Line and draining  eastward to Greenwich Bay.  This Cove encompasses 287 hectares  (709 acres) and is located in a heavily developed area within  Warwick.  In addition, a railway  has physically  divided  the wetland.  The portion  of the  cove on the  west side of the  tracks  is fresh water  and  is adjacent to US Route  1.  Hamilton Cove, North  Kingstown  is located east of US Route  1, north  of the Jamestown Bridge and south of Wickford Harbor.   The  cove encompasses  204 hectares  (504 acres)  and  has fringe saltmarsh protected by a peninsula with  some upland  hardwoods.   The  bay side of the  peninsula  is a cobble beach.  There  are indications  that wave action may cause the peninsulas  to become isolated,  hence forming an island.  The majority of the focus area is under private  ownership.  However, several small (¡ 2 hectares/5 acres) tracts of land are undeveloped and  have acquisition  potential.  A large contiguous  parcel  of open space in the  southeastern portion  of the Hamilton  Cove focus area was recently  donated to Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM)  by Narragansett Electric  Company.   This  area  of open space is managed  by Rhode  Island  Division of Parks  and Recreation and allows for a variety  of public use activities  (biking and hiking trails, picnicking etc).

Conservation Recommendations: Recommendations include the purchase  of surrounding upland  habitat and wetlands  associated  with  the  Arnold  Neck  and  Hamilton  Cove  Focus  Areas.   Upland  acquisition  should be extensive  enough  to  serve as an  adequate buffer from visual  and  aural  disturbance as well as physical disturbance.  The  undeveloped  portions  of the  upland  habitat surrounding the  salt  and  fresh water  pond draining  into Arnold  Neck are in need of protection

from any future development. In addition, enhancement actions should be taken to improve the water quality and  therefore  habitat quality  of these  wetlands.   Finally,  the  spread  of non-native invasive  species such as,

Phragmites has negatively  impacted  the  habitat quality  off these  wetlands.   A management plan  should be developed and implemented to restore  and enhance  the habitat quality  provide  in these areas.

Boyd Marsh and Fogland  Point,  Rhode Island Boyd Marsh is located  at the north  end of Portsmouth along Mt.  Hope Bay and encompasses 129 hectares  (319 acres).  The marsh  is isolated to the east, south,  and west by roads and development. An abandon railway is located to the north  of the marsh;  yet, a connection  exists to the Mount Hope Bay allowing tidal intrusion  into the marsh creating  brackish  conditions.  The marsh  was partially filled by the  Army  Corps of Engineers  (circa  1945).  In addition, the  town  of Portsmouth and  the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management permitted the construction of a golf course on the fill site.  Fogland  Point and  associated  wetlands  are located  in the  towns  of Little  Compton  and  Tiverton. Fogland Point marsh consists of 14 hectares  (37 acres) saltmarsh, 39 hectares  (97 acres) of upland  hardwoods and brush adjacent to the Sakonnet  River.  Associated  wetlands  include a forested swamp on the west side of Puncatest Neck Road and unnamed  pond on the east side of the road.  In addition, Nonquit  Pond,  a public drinking  water  supply  area,  is located  within  the  Fogland  Point Focus  Area.   Adjacent uplands  include pasture and  row crop agriculture and  residential  areas.   Total  area  size is 982 hectares  (2,427 acres).   The Rhode  Island  Department  of Environmental Managements (RI  DEM)  Division  of Fish  and  Wildlife owns a 22-hectare  (56 acres)  parcel  in the  center  of Boyds Marsh.   In addition, RI DEM  Division of Parks  and Recreation owns a 2 hectare  (5 acres)  parcel  located  at  the  northern end of the  marsh  and  including  part of the coastline.  However, the majority of the Boyds Marsh  Focus Area is under  private  ownership.  Several moderate to large (4 - ¿40 hectare/10 - ¿100 acres) tracts of land are located  directly  adjacent to the marsh, including  a golf course and contain  conservation action  potential.  Surrounding uplands  associated  with the Fogland  Point Focus Area are privately owned in large landholdings. However, over 202 hectares  (500 acres) within  this area are currently preserved  in some fashion (e.g., outright sale, development rights).

Conservation  Recommendations:   Recommendations  include  the  purchase  of surrounding upland  habitat and  wetlands  associated  with  Boyd Marsh.   Upland  acquisition  should  be extensive  enough  to serve as an adequate buffer from visual and aural disturbance as well as physical disturbance. Finally,  restoration efforts are necessary to control and eliminate  the spread of invasive species, particularly Phragmites australis. Many large parcels  remain  within  the  Fogland  Point focus area  including  farms.   Acquisition  of these  parcels  or development rights  would be integral  in preserving  the integrity of the wetlands  within  this focus area.

Briggs Marsh,  Rhode  Island  Briggs Marsh,  an 84.6-ha (209 acres)  shallow coastal  pond,  is located  in Little Compton, Rhode  Island  and  encompasses  1,001 hectares  (2,474 acres).  The  wetland  (historically recorded as Awaskonk  Marsh)  is unique  in that prior  to  1920 it  was a saltmarsh open  to  the  Atlantic Ocean  via a navigable  outlet.   At some point  in time  after  1920, a barrier  beach  formed  across  the  outlets  opening. Water  levels in the  marsh  now vary  depending  on freshwater  inﬂow of three  seasonal  streams  and  periodic breaching.   Annual  breaching  of Briggs Marsh  occurs in the  southwest section  of the  barrier  beach  during


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  103

spring and after storms.  Salinity  levels in the marsh  range between 7 to 12 parts  per thousand (ppt). Water levels in the  marsh  range  to  ¡1.5 meters  (5 feet).   Shoreline  vegetation on the  marsh  consists  primarily  of Phragmites intermixed with narrow  leaf cattail and traces  of bulrush.  Three  islands are located  in the west end of the  marsh  and  contain  native  trees  and  ground  cover of trout lilies.  Uplands  surrounding the  area contain  stands  of mixed hardwoods,  pastures, cornfields, and lawns.  The majority of the focus area is under private  ownership.  However, several areas are protected including  the eastern  portions  of Briggs Marsh  and the  southern section  of Quicksand  Pond.   In addition, several  smaller  parcels  are under  ownership  by The Nature  Conservancy  and the local land trust.

Conservation  Recommendations:  There  is a  considerable  amount  of land  in  rather large  parcels  within the  focus area  and  are  prime  areas  for conservation acquisition  either  through outright sale, conservation easement,  development rights  or other  avenues.  Conservation actions  could include assisting  the local land- trust to acquirer  development rights  of those properties  not currently in holding.  Finally,  restoration efforts are necessary  to control  and eliminate  the spread

of invasive species, particularly Phragmites and purple  loosestrife.


Coastal  Ponds,  Rhode  Island  Rhode  Islands  southern coastline  hosts  a string  of barrier  beaches  and  back- barrier  coastal lagoons known locally as salt ponds.  These ponds are similar in their general size and habitat types  but  vary  in terms  of level of development  and  tidal  connection.   Quonochontaug Pond,  Winnapaug Pond,  Ninigret  Pond,  Potter Pond,  and the Galilee Bird Sanctuary maintain a permanent connection  to the ocean through breachways  and  thus  have plants  and  animals  associated  with  marine  and  estuarine ecosys­ tems  including  extensive  backbarrier salt-marshes and  ﬂoodtidal  deltas  and  sand  ﬂats.   Trustom Pond  is breached  annually  or as needed for water  quality  and wildlife management and the wetlands  retain  brackish conditions.   Several  smaller  freshwater  ponds  are  located  within  the  Point Judith Ponds  Sub-Focus  Area. Total  area  size is 5,684 hectares  (14,045 acres).  The  majority  of the  focus area  is under  private  ownership. However, several large tracts of land  are under  state  and  federal protection. Included  in these  is the  South Shore Management  Area  (SSMA)  owned by the  Rhode  Island  Department  of Environmental Management (RI  DEM).  This  includes  a network  of coastal  agricultural fields managed  for Canada  Goose hunting.  RI DEM also owns portions  of the Galilee Bird Sanctuary, which is a recently  restored  saltmarsh and operates several state  beaches.  In addition, the United  States  Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)  owns two relatively large refuges within  the Ninigret  Pond  and Trustom Pond  Sub-Focus  Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Recommendations include the purchase  of surrounding upland  habitat and wetlands  associated  with  the  Coastal  Ponds  focus area.   Upgrading  septic  systems  for houses  around  the ponds may be needed to limit the nutrient input  and eutrophication of the ponds.  Upland  acquisition  should be extensive  enough  to  serve as an  adequate buffer from visual  and  aural  disturbance as well as physical


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  104

disturbance and  to protect the  water  quality  of the  ponds.  Controlled access may be necessary  depending on the  accessibility  of protected lands.   Many  of the  wetlands  associated  with  this  focus area  have  been subjected  to the spread  of non-native invasive species such as Phragmites purple  loosestrife, and coontail.  A management plan should be developed and implemented to restore and enhance the habitat quality  provide in these areas.  Narragansett Bay Islands, Rhode Island The islands located within Narragansett Bay are similar in their  geological formation  and  bedrock  composition.   However, three  of these  islands  are unique  in that they contain  predator-free habitat.  That is to say, that these islands contain  no known mammalian predator populations (e.g., fox, coyote, raccoon).  Rose Island is approximately 16 acres, located south of the Claiborne Pell Bridge between  Jamestown and Newport.  Gould Island  (West  Passage)  is located  in Narragansett Bay north  of the  Claiborne  Pell  Bridge  between  Jamestown and  Middletown.    Gould  Island  is dominated by exotic  deciduous  species  including  autumn olive,  asiatic  bittersweet, Japanese black  pine,  and  Sycamore maple.   Dyer  Island  is a  32-acre  island  located  west  of Melville,  Portsmouth and  southeast of Prudence Island.   Habitat consists  of a 2 acre saltmarsh, with  upland  comprised  of, but  not  limited  to,  blackberries, staghorn sumac, asiatic  bittersweet, northern bayberry, black chokeberry,  eastern  red cedar, Japanese black pine, and  tree-of-heaven. The  Rose Island  Lighthouse  Foundation (RILF)  currently owns Rose Island.  The RILF  has restored  the  Rose Island  Lighthouse  and  uses it as a museum  and  guest  house.  The  surrounding portions  of the  island  are  overgrown  with  multiﬂora   rose  and  contain  dilapidated brick  structures.   The Rhode  Island  Department of Environmental Management (RI DEM)  currently owns approximately 66% of the  23-hectare  (57-acres)  island  known  as Gould  Island.   The  remaining  portion  of the  island  is owned by the  Federal  Government Department of Defense.  The  Navy expropriated the  island  in 1919 and  it became a major  seaplane  base  and  torpedo  testing  station during  WWII.  Abandoned in the  1970s, a segment  of the  island  was turned over to RI DEM during  the  mid-1970s.  Unfortunately the  island  remains  listed  as a biohazard dumpsite  waiting to be cleaned up by the Navy.  In addition, a coal dump remains on the southern portion  of the island The state  of Rhode Island purchased Dyer Island as part  of its Estuarine Sanctuary in
2001. The island has an elevation  of 4 meters  (13 feet) above sea level, making it vulnerable  to storm surges.


Conservation Recommendations:  Recommendations include  the  purchase  of the  islands  as well as habitat restoration.  Restoration in the  form of clean up of waste,  potential demolition  and  removal  of some, non- historic  structures, invasive species control  and revegetation with native  species.

Pettaquamscutt Cove, Rhode Island Pettaquamscutt Cove is located in southern Rhode Island at the south­ ern end of the  Narrow  River estuary  where it feeds into Rhode  Island  Sound at  the  mouth  of Narragansett Bay.   The  cove encompasses  971 hectares  (2,399 acres)  and  is bordered  by  South  Kingstown  to  the  west and Narragansett to the east.  This shallow estuarine system receives freshwater  inﬂuence from an extensive wetland  system  including  Carr  Pond  to the  north.   This  tidal  cove is bordered  on all sides by fringing salt- marsh  habitat. The  majority of the  focus area  is under  private  ownership.   However, several tracts of land are under  state  and federal protection. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)  owns a refuge located

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  105

along Pettaquamscutt Cove known  as the  John  Chafee  National  Wildlife Refuge.  In addition, the  Rhode Island  Department of Environmental Management and  the  Audubon  Society  of Rhode  Island  own several scattered parcels within  the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations: Recommendations include the purchase  of surrounding upland  habitat and wetlands  associated  with  the  Pettaquamscutt Cove  Focus  Area.   Upland  acquisition  should  be extensive enough  to  serve as an  adequate buffer from visual  and  aural  disturbance as well as physical  disturbance. Finally,  invasive species, particularly Phragmites have encroached  along the fringe salt- marsh  and degraded the  quality  of habitat in these  areas.  A management plan should be developed and  implemented to restore and enhance  the habitat quality  provided  in these areas.

ACE  Basin,  South  Carolina  The  ACE  Basin  Focus  area  is located  in the  southern coastal  region of South Carolina  and  includes 675,221 hectares  (1,668,501 acres)  of the  drainage  basins  of the  Ashepoo,  Combahee and  Edisto  Rivers.   The  focus area  includes  all of Colleton  County and  portions  of Charleston, Beaufort, Hampton, Dorchester, Orangeburg and  Bamberg  Counties.   Extending inland  from the  Atlantic Ocean,  the area  consists  primarily  of managed  wetland  impoundments, fresh and  saltwater tidal  marsh,  and  forested wetlands.  Managed  wetlands  provide  migration and wintering  habitat for large numbers  of dabbling  ducks. Ownership  patterns of the area include state,  federal and local government owned lands, with a large compo­ nent of privately-owned lands,  including  forest industry lands.  In the lower portion  of the focus area,  nearly
64,753 hectares  (160,007 acres)  have been protected from development by various  conservation mechanisms including over 25,000 hectares  (61,776 acres) in conservation easements.  Over 20,235 hectares  (50,001 acres) of public land have been protected through state  parks,  state  wildlife management areas,  a national  wildlife refuge (ACE Basin National  Wildlife Refuge) and a national estuarine research reserve (ACE Basin Reserve).

Conservation Recommendations: Strategic tracts should be protected through acquisition  by state,  federal and  non-governmental  conservation organizations.   Conservation  easements  will continue  to  be  a  major protection method  in the  region.  Protection of wetlands  along river  corridors  will be a major  focus in the future.

CAWS Basin, South Carolina The CAWS Basin (Cooper, Ashley, Wando,  and Stono) Focus Area is located in the central  coastal  region of South  Carolina  and includes the Charleston Metropolitan Area.  Approximately
329,887 hectares  (815,165 acres) in size, it includes major portions of Berkeley and Charleston Counties  and a small portion  of Dorchester  County. The CAWS Basin Focus Area encompasses  the drainages  of the Ashley, Cooper, Stono, and Wando  Rivers which form the Charleston Harbor  Estuarine Drainage  Area.  These rivers originate  as short  blackwater streams  in the  lower coastal  plain.  The Santee-Cooper Hydroelectric  Project, upstream on the  Cooper  River,  diverts  some water  ﬂow from  the  Santee  River  watershed  to  the  Cooper River  Watershed for hydroelectric and  ﬂood control  purposes.   Because  of its large size, the  CAWS  Basin


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  106

Focus Area was subdivided  into three sections (sub-focus areas)  in 1997: Stono/Sea Islands,  Cooper/Wando Rivers,  and Ashley River.  Ownership  patterns within  the focus area include federal, state,  county, and city, as well as numerous  private  properties. Large private  plantations exist along all of the river systems  and on the  barrier  islands.  This  area  consists  of former rice plantations which are largely undeveloped  and  harbor important natural habitats including  tidal,  managed,  and  forested  wetlands,  as well as upland  forests  and agricultural areas.

Conservation Recommendations: Important wintering,   nesting,  and  foraging  habitats need  to  protected from destruction and  disturbance. As many  of these  areas  need to be protected via conservation easement or purchase  and  they  need to be done on a large landscape  scale.  Disturbance from the  increasing  number of residents,  industries, and  development along with  the  pollution  that accompanies  them  need to be kept in check.  A major  effort should  be to  protect the  large  tracts on both  the  riverine  systems  and  adjacent uplands  that are being sold off by the large timber  companies.

Santee River, South Carolina The focus areas includes the ﬂoodplain of the Santee River from the Santee Dam to the  Atlantic Ocean at  Cedar  Island,  involving portions  of Berkeley,  Charleston, Clarendon, Georgetown, and Williamsburg Counties.  The coastal marshes of this focus area occupies 221,692 hectares  (547,813 acres), including  significant areas  of managed  wetlands.   This  marsh  area represents 32% of the  states  total  marsh area.   A significant portion  of this  focus area  also encompasses  the  Francis  Marion  National  Forest,  one of the  largest  remaining  remnants of the  fire dependent  longleaf pine  ecosystem.   The  USDA Forest  Service is moving towards  restoration of this  ecosystem  on public  lands  in the  focus area.  Much of this  focus area is protected in public  ownerships:  the  Francis  Marion  National  Forest  (established in 1936), and  the  Cape Romain National  Wildlife Refuge (established in 1932). There are numerous  state  wildlife management areas in the focus area,  as well as a large number  of private  properties  protected through conservation easements.

Conservation Recommendations: It is recommended  that wetland  habitat in this  focus area  continue  to be protected by the active  pursuit of conservation easements,  deed restrictions, Memoranda of Understanding, management agreements, gifts, and purchase.

South  Lowcountry, South  Carolina  South  Carolinas  South  Lowcountry  Focus  Area  contains  approximately

860,993 hectares  (2,127,552 acres) located along the lower Savannah River, encompassing the western portion of Aiken County, all of Barnwell, Allendale, and Jasper  Counties,  and the majority of Hampton and Beaufort Counties.   The  goal of the  South  Lowcountry  Focus  Area  task  force is to  protect all properties  along the Savannah River from the Savannah National  Wildlife Refuge, including  the Savannah River Site, northward along the  river  until  it meets  with  the  Upper  Savannah River  Focus  Area  at  the  Fall  Line.  The  task  force is also  focusing  on  protection of other  drainages  ﬂowing  into  and  parallel  to  the  Savannah River.    The landownership patterns of the  South  Lowcountry  Focus  Area  are  still  relatively  unfragmented and  rather


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  107
American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



large  with  most  landowners  along  the  Savannah River  owning  anywhere  from  several  hundred  to  several thousand acres.   Protected areas  on the  Savannah River  include  the  Savannah National  Wildlife  Refuge, Webb  Wildlife  Management Area,  Palachucola Wildlife  Management Area  (United  States  Army  Core  of Engineers),  and the Savannah River Site.  Land  ownership  patterns are unique  to this area,  with 60 private plantations contributing significantly  to the natural landscape  of the area.  Wildlife and forest management are emphasized  on most  of these  plantations.  These  large landownerships are a tremendous benefit  to the habitat protection strategy of the South  Lowcountry  Focus Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Efforts should be made to increase  private  landowner  participation in the South Lowcountry  Focus Area and to increase the number  of properties  protected by conservation easements. State  and  Federal  oﬃcials should  also work to  leverage  funding  for habitat protection projects  along  the Savannah River  Corridor.    One  of the  major  conservation actions  in this  focus area  is the  protection of remaining  bottomland hardwood  forests.  From  the  Savannah River  Site to the  Atlantic Ocean,  significant tracts of undeveloped  forested  wetlands   remain.    These  lands  should  be  acquired  or  protected through conservation easements  by federal, state,  or private  conservation organizations. The pine uplands  have great potential for restoration to longleaf pine.  Significant  issues are associated  with  the  three  major  reservoirs and the Savannah River Site, and actions  should be taken  to reduce and minimize all activities  that impact water  quality.  In the upper  portion  of the focus area,  measures  should be taken  to reduce impacts  to water quality  from timber  production and  excessive recreational use.  Riparian areas  and  associated  watersheds should be protected.

Upper  Waccamaw  River,  South  Carolina  The  Waccamaw  River  is classified as a blackwater river  system. Blackwater rivers typically originate  in the coastal  plain and have a dark tint because of tannic  acid leached from organic  matter.  The  Waccamaw  River  is also unique  in that it  is the  only river  originating from a Carolina  Bay,  beginning  at  Lake Waccamaw  in Columbus  County,  North  Carolina.   The  Waccamaw  River has a large, relatively unbroken  riverine bottomland hardwood ecosystem This focus area encompasses 43,433 hectares  (107,320 acres)  in Horry County. Many key tracts within  the focus area currently owned by forest industry or non-industrial forest  landowners.   However,  significant  holdings  by state  government  do exist. The  South  Carolina  Department of Natural Resources  owns the  Waccamaw  River  Heritage  Preserve  and Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage  Preserve.  At least one conservation easement has been placed on a private  tract.

Conservation Recommendations: Strategic  tracts should be protected through acquisition  by state  and non­ governmental conservation organizations. The pursuit of conservation easements  will be a major  protection method  in the region.  Protection of wetlands  along river corridors  will be a major  focus in the future.

Little  Pee Dee-Lumber  Rivers,  South  Carolina  This focus area encompasses  65,256 hectares  (161,251 acres)

in portions  of Marion, Dillon, and Florence Counties.  Many key tracts within the focus area currently owned

by forest  industry or non-industrial forest  landowners.   However,  significant  holdings  by state  government do exist.   The  South  Carolina  Department of Natural Resources  owns the  Little  Pee  Dee River  Heritage Preserve  in Marion  and  Horry  counties  adjacent to the  Little  Pee Dee and  Lumber  Rivers,  and  Cartwheel Bay Heritage  Preserve.

Conservation Recommendations: Strategic  tracts should be protected through acquisition  by state  and non­ governmental conservation organizations. The pursuit of conservation easements  will be a major  protection method  in the region.  Protection of wetlands  along river corridors  will be a major  focus in the future.

Great  Pee Dee-Lynches  Rivers,  South  Carolina  The Great  Pee Dee-Lynches  Focus Area is 254,044 hectares (627,756 acres)  and  includes  portions  of Chesterfield,  Darlington, Dillon, Florence,  Lee, Marion,  Marlboro and Sumter  Counties.  All of the upper  portions  of the Great  Pee Dee River ﬂoodplain  and the entire  lower portion of the Lynches Rivers ﬂoodplain are included, as well as significant portions of Jefferies Creek.  Several significant wetland  habitats such  as oxbow lakes,  beaver  ponds  and  vernal  ponds  occur  in the  ﬂoodplain forests  of the  Great  Pee  Dee.   These  wetlands  provide  key habitat for many  wetland  dependent  species. Most key areas within the focus area currently owned by forest industry or non-industrial forest landowners. However, significant holdings by state  and local governments do exist.  South Carolina Department of Natural Resources owns one property in Darlington County adjacent to the Great  Pee Dee River.  Other  government entities  include Lee State  Natural Area on the Lynches River in Lee County, and the Lynches River County Park  and  Pee  Dee Station Wildlife Management Areas,  both  in Florence.   Several  State  Natural Heritage Preserves  are  located  within  this  focus area.   The  Carolina  Sandhills  National  Wildlife Refuge  is located adjacent to this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations: Strategic  tracts should be protected through acquisition  by state  and non­ governmental conservation organizations. The pursuit of conservation easements  will be a major  protection method  in the region.  Protection of wetlands  along river corridors  will be a major  focus in the future.

Catawba River Basin, South  Carolina  The Catawba Focus Area consists of 386,524 hectares  (955,119 acres) bordering  both  sides of the  Catawba River  from the  North  Carolina  line to  the  Wateree  Dam.   The  east boundary of the property extends  from the North  Carolina  line south  on Hwy 521 to Dekalb.  The boundary then  shoots  across country  to the  Wateree  Dam  and  again  across country  to Hwy 34.  The  boundary then follows Hwy 321 North  and then  Hwy 161 to the North  Carolina  line.  The northern boundary of this focus area is the North  Carolina  / South Carolina  line. This focus area includes parts  of York, Chester,  Lancaster, Fairfield,  and Kershaw Counties.  While the Piedmont area does not consist of the typical wetlands  as found in the  Coastal  Plain,  the  forested  wetlands  provide  extensive  breeding,  migration, and  wintering  habitat waterfowl.   Ownership  patterns of the  area  include  state  and  local government-owned lands,  with  a large component  of privately-owned lands,  including  forest  industry and  energy  subsidiary  lands.   Examples  of

protected lands include Landsford  Canal  State  Park,  Landsford  Forest  Legacy Area, Historic  Brattonsville, Lake Wateree  State  Recreational Area, and Draper  Wildlife Management Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Strategic tracts should be protected through acquisition  by state,  federal and  non-governmental conservation organizations.  Conservation easements  will continue  to be a protection method  in the region.  Protection of wetlands  along river corridors  will be a major  focus in the future.

Congaree-Wateree/Upper Santee Rivers, South Carolina The focus area encompasses 127,264 hectares (314,475 acres) in the ﬂoodplain and adjoining uplands associated  with the Congaree River, the Wateree  River, and the upper portion  of the Santee  River.  The area supports a great abundance and diversity  of wetland-associated wildlife species.  Despite  habitat alterations throughout much  of the  focus area,  significant  amount  of old growth forest still occurs here.  The Congaree  River is inﬂuenced upstream by Lake Murray  and Parr  Reser­ voir.   The  Wateree  River  is inﬂuenced  upstream by Wateree  Lake.   Other  inﬂuences  include  urban  storm water  run-off, mining, agriculture, and forestry  practices.  The ownership of properties  within  the focus area
is mostly  private.  There  are,  however,  several  notable  parcels  of publicly  owned property.  The  Congaree Swamp  National  Park  located  on the  eastern  side of the  Congaree  River,  was established to  preserve  old growth  bottomland forest.  On the  eastern  side of the  Wateree  River  is the  Manchester State  Forest.   The upper  reaches  of the  Santee  River  are actually  the  swampy  head  of Lake Marion.  This  area,  referred  to as the upper  Santee  Swamp,  is publicly  owned by the S.C. Public  Service Authority. State  Heritage  Preserves protect significant ecological areas at Congaree Creek and Congaree Bluff. Most of the privately owned land in the focus area is managed  as timberland or agricultural land.  Management for waterfowl and other wildlife species and wildlife-associated  recreation are primary  objectives  of many  landowners  within  the  focus area. Because of the proximity  of these  bottomlands to the Columbia  Metropolitan Area, many  of the properties are owned by land consortiums  as recreational properties. A limited number  of the private  lands in the focus area are under  legal conservation easements.  A portion  of the Santee  National  Wildlife Refuge is within  this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Conservation needs for the  Congaree/Wateree/Upper Santee  Focus  Area should  be centered  on preserving  the  integrity of this  large  undeveloped  forested  wetland.   Incentives  for private  landowners  to manage  for longer rotations of timber  should  be sought.   Portions of the  area  must be preserved  for older growth  forest  management through acquisition  or easements.   A strategy to protect against  fragmentation of this  unique  bottomland is vital.   Measures  should  be taken  to reduce  impacts  to water  quality from non-point source pollution,  leveeing, agriculture, and logging activity.

Connecticut River, Vermont & New Hampshire  The Connecticut River Focus Area is a shared focus area be­ tween Vermont and New Hampshire.  It extends from Third  Connecticut Lake on the New Hampshire/Quebec border  to the Massachusetts state  boundary. The focus area boundaries  extend  5 kilometers  (3 miles) from


USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  110

the  centerline  of the  river  into  both  Vermont and  New Hampshire.   Both  sides of the  river  are punctuated by  numerous  oxbow wetlands,  and  extensive  willow/alder swales,  forested  wetlands,  and  open,  emergent marshes  are adjacent to the  river throughout much of its length.  These wetlands  provide  important breed­ ing and  migratory stopover  habitat several  species of waterfowl.   Although  only 11% of the  watershed  is under  agriculture, most  of this  lies adjacent to  the  river  and  within  the  focus area  (U.S.  Fish  & Wildlife Service 1995). Agricultural crops often increase the value of sheet water habitats that commonly occur here, especially in the  spring,  and  provide  an important resource  for migratory birds  during  their  annual  cycle. Much  of the  Connecticut Valley  is privately owned.   However,  many  large  tracts within  and  adjacent  to the  focus area  are now either  in conservation ownership  or protected by conservation easements.   The  Ver­ mont portion  of the  focus area includes 5,615 hectares  (13,875 acres)  of state  land,  10,946 hectares  (27,050 acres) of privately-owned conservation land, 2,610 hectares  (6,450 acres) of municipally  owned land, and 384 hectares  (950 acres) of federal land.  The focus area lies entirely  within the approved  boundaries  of the Silvio O. Conte  National  Fish  and  Wildlife Refuge (SOC  NFWR). Immediately to the  west of the  focus area  in Vermont is the 8,903 hectare  (22,000 acres) West Mountain Wildlife Management Area (WMA)  and–further west–the  10,521 hectare  (26,000 acres) Nulhegan  Basin Division of the SOC NFWR.  These lands are part  of a contiguous  53,823 hectare  (133,000 acres) block of land formerly owned by Champion  International Paper Company  and now held in easement or fee by conservation entities  (33,993 hectares  or 84,000 acres of which are  on land  owned by Essex  Timber  Company).  Other  large  blocks of conservation land  are  on the  New Hampshire  side of the  river,  including  a 69,403 hectare  (171,500 acres)  conservation easement brokered  by the Trust for Public  Lands,  The Nature  Conservancy  (TNC)  and the State  of New Hampshire,  and another
7,689 hectare  (19,000 acres)  parcel  in conservation easement held  by TNC.  Several  of these  projects  were supported by a 2001 North  American  Wetland Conservation Act grant.  Vermont state  lands along the river include  Roaring  Brook,  Fairlee  Marsh  and  Skitchewaug  WMA;  Ascutney  and  Fort  Dummer  State  Park; and  Thetford Hill State  Forest.   In New Hampshire,  public  lands  include  the  Lime Pond  and  Huntington Hill Conservation Easements; Fort  Hill, Reeds,  Hubbard Farms,  Great  Island,  Cornish,  and  Wilder  WMA; Hidden  Valley Wildlife Conservation Area;  Hubbard Hill, Cape  Horn,  and  Connecticut River  State  Forest, and Wantastiquet Mountain Natural Area.

Conservation Recommendations: The  purpose  of the  Silvio O. Conte  National  Fish  and  Wildlife Refuge is to protect the native  diversity  of ﬂora and fauna throughout the Connecticut River Watershed. The actions of the  refuge include  working with all partners within  the  watershed  through a variety  of federal and  state programs  to meet the goals set forth  by the refuge.  These programs,  not limited  to the refuge, include land acquisition,  managing  or regulating public  use, control  of exotic species, dam  removal,  and  other  programs designed to enhance  and conserve the rich natural resources of the Connecticut River Valley.

Lake Champlain Valley, Vermont/New York The  Lake Champlain Valley Focus  Area  encompasses  398,851 hectares  (985,577 acres) and includes the narrow Lake Champlain Valley between the Adirondack  Mountains

USFWS Focal Species Program                                                                                                  111

of New York and the Green Mountains of Vermont. The valley is very different from the surrounding areas with  a strong  alliance  to the  St.  Lawrence  Valley and  the  Great  Lakes lowlands (Thompson and  Sorenson
2000). Historically,  the valley was dominated by northern hardwoods  (Laughlin  and Kibbe 1985). However, fertile soils and  gently rolling topography made  the  valley one of the  most  productive agricultural areas  in the  northeastern United  States.   The  wetlands  of the  Lake Champlain Valley form numerous  and  diverse communities.  Much  of the  lakeshore  wetlands  are  comprised  of ﬂoodplain  forests  that are  ﬂooded  every spring  with  the  rise  of water  levels.   In  addition, highly  productive forested,  emergent,  and  scrub-shrub wetlands  are  associated  with  the  deltas  formed  by several  large  rivers  draining  into  the  lake.   Submerged aquatic  vegetation is prevalent in the  shallow bays especially in the  Missisquoi Bay on the  northern end of the  lake and  South  Bay in the  extreme  southern end.  Also, several unique  lakeside bogs are located  in the northern one-third  of the  lake.  Palustrine forested  and  emergent wetlands  created  through beaver  activity make up most  of the  wetlands  found throughout the  valley and  associated  with  the  many  tributaries that feed into  Lake Champlain.  Sub-focus areas  encompass  45,248 hectares  (111,809 acres).   Much  of the  Lake Champlain Valley is in private  ownership.  However, the states  of Vermont and New York own a number  of Wildlife Management  Areas  and  State  Parks  along the  shore  of Lake Champlain.  Much  of the  New York side of Lake Champlain forms the eastern  boundary of the Adirondack  Park  extending  from approximately Port  Kent,  New York to  the  southern tip  of the  lake,  South  Bay.   Federally-owned properties  include  the Missisquoi National  Wildlife Refuge, which encompasses  the  Missisquoi Delta,  the  largest  wetland  delta  on Lake Champlain.

Conservation Recommendations: Disturbance to breeding  and migrating birds should be minimized or elim­ inated.  Efforts should be made to control  point and non-point source pollution  to improve the water  quality of Lake Champlain. Control  of invasive species is needed to maintain or improve the biodiversity  and habitat quality  of the lake and the associated  wetlands  and uplands.  Also, effort should be made to support and en­ gage the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its mission to coordinate  the development of a comprehensive plan for the Lake Champlain Basin.

Lake Memphremagog, Vermont The Lake Memphremagog Focus Area encompasses 313,816 hectares (775,452 acres)  and  includes the  entire  county of Orleans  and  parts  of Essex.  The  eastern  border  is adjacent to the Connecticut River Focus Area, which extends  5 kilometers  (3 miles) from the center  of the river.  The focus area is laced with rivers and  creeks.  Remote  wooded swamps,  bogs, and  beaver  ﬂowages are prevalent over the Lake Memphremagog area.  The area is poorly drained  over large expanses and generally less productive with more acidic water than  Lake Champlain. However, the value of the area lies in the aggregate of the many remote  wetlands  that have high value for black duck and  other  waterfowl  and  waterbirds. A few relatively large wetlands  occur around  the Black and Barton  Rivers at South  Bay in Lake Memphremagog and along the  Clyde  River,  also near  the  southern end  of the  lake.   Several  large  lakes,  including  Memphremagog, occur in the focus area and include Seymour,  Averill, and Caspian  Lakes and Lake Willoughby.  These areas

provide  important deep-water  habitat for species such as Common  Loon.  The  majority of the  focus area is privately owned.  However, over 40,480 hectares  (100,027 acres) of private  forest lands are publicly accessible. The  State  of Vermont  manages  six Wildlife Management  Areas  including  the  4,170 hectare  (10,374 acres) Bill Sladyk and the 9,190 hectare  (22,708 acres))  West  Mountain Areas.  In addition  several state  parks and state  forests  are within  the  boundaries  of the  focus area  including  Groton  State  Forest,  Vermont’s  second largest  parcel  of state-owned land  at  10,580 hectares  (26,143 acres).   The  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service’s Silvio O. Conte  National  Fish  and  Wildlife Refuge manages  the  Nulhegan  Basin,  a 10,520 hectare  (25,995 acres)  National  Wildlife Refuge adjacent to West  Mountain Wildlife Management Area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Although  timber  harvesting can  be detrimental to  wetland  quality,  it  is extremely  valuable  to the  local and  regional  economy.  Loss of the  economic sustainability of the  industry could  result  in  permanent  loss of wetlands  through  development.   Disturbance to  remote  wetlands  and water  bodies important for waterfowl and waterbird nesting  should be minimized,  through buffer zones that limit  harvest  intensity.  Further development (shoreline  or adjacent) of remote  lakes and  ponds  should  be minimized  through fee or easement acquisitions  of property that provides  high quality  habitat.

Delmarva  Peninsula, Virginia The Eastern Shore of Virginia contains  a wide diversity  of waterfowl habitats. An extensive set of coastal saltmarshes and series of undeveloped  barrier  islands run the length of the Eastern Shore from Maryland to Fishermans’  Island National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  On the Bayside of the Shore, brackish  tidal  marshes  abound  from Saxis Island to Hacks Neck encompass 102,225 hectare  (252,601 acres). A  series  of islands  occurs  in  the  Chesapeake   Bay  along  these  brackish  marshes.    The  Eastern Shore  is primarily  a rural  agricultural, aquacultural community and includes 149,661 hectare  (369,819 acres).  Many individuals  earn  their  living  from  the  wetland  community, including  oystermen, crabbers,  clammers,  and commercial  fishermen.   In  recent times,  an  agricultural shift  has  occurred  from  row crops  to  commercial vegetable  production, resulting  in a loss of foraging habitat for many waterfowl species.  Additionally, many individuals  have taken  to purchasing tracts of former wetlands  and  restoring  these  sites to emergent marsh systems,  resulting  in the  concentration of waterfowl  on managed  wetland  habitats.  The  total  area  of this focus area  is 251,886 hectares  (622,420 acres).   Several  groups  are working to protect the  valuable  natural communities on  the  Eastern Shore.   Three  National   Wildlife  Refuges  (NWRs)  are  located  in  this  focus area.   Chincoteague National  Wildlife Refuge  NWR  is located  on the  Maryland border,  and  the  Eastern Shore  NWR  and  Fishermans’   Island  NWR  are  located  on  the  extreme  southern end  of the  Shore.   The Nature  Conservancy  owns several  of the  seaside barrier  islands,  and  owns or holds conservation easements on a number  of seaside farms.   The  Virginia  Department of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries  owns four wildlife management areas,  two on the bayside and two on the seaside (The  GATR  tract, Mockhorn Island Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Saxis WMA and Guards  Shore WMA) The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation owns one state  park and two natural areas and a barrier  island (Wreck Island) on the bayside of the eastern  shore.  Additionally, many individuals  have taken  to purchasing tracts of former wetlands  and

restoring  these  sites  to  emergent marsh  systems,  resulting  in the  concentration of waterfowl  on managed wetland  habitats.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help  this  area  retain  its  usefulness  for migratory birds.   Prior-converted crop  fields that are restored to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these  sites  will help  wintering  and  staging  waterfowl  populations.  Exotic  invasives,  such  as Phragmites are continuing  to gain a foothold in the area, and treatment of these sites needs to be continued. Future zoning  of lands  to  reduce  development will ensure  the  continued rural  setting  of this  community. Lower Potomac River, Virginia The Potomac River focus area is located in Northeast Virginia encompassing
168,573 hectares  (416,551 acres).   The  area  as  a  whole is considerably  developed,  as  would  be expected in Northern Virginia.   The  brackish  and  freshwater  tidal  wetlands  are relatively  undeveloped,  and  provide a  wide  diversity  of habitat for  black  ducks  and  other  waterfowl  species.   The  Potomac River  proper  is owned by the  State  of Maryland, and  is not  included  in the  focus area.  The  adjacent marshes  are located in Virginia  and  are  included.   These  marshes  are  composed  of highly  brackish  Spartina marshes  near  the mouth  of the Potomac to freshwater  Peltandra, Lotus and wild rice marshes  inland.  Historically,  hardwood forests  dominated areas  beyond  the  river.    These  forests  have  given  way  to  row  crop  agriculture, truck farms,  horse/hobby farms,  loblolly pine plantations, and  residential  and  industrial development. In recent historical  times,  the  shallow water  areas  of the  Potomac have a history  of high-density submerged  aquatic vegetation (SAV)  beds  (Hydrilla).  The  majority of land  in this  focus area  is in private  ownership.   The U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service owns Masons Neck National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR)  and  Marumsco  NWR, The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation owns several state  parks,  Mason Neck State  Park, Leesylvania State  Park,  Caledon Natural Area, and Westmoreland State Park,  as well as several small natural area  preserves.   Additional federal  ownership  in the  area  includes  Quantico  Marine  Corps  Base,  Dahlgren Laboratory, George Washington Birthplace National  Monument, and Fort  Belvoir Military  Reservation.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these sites will help wintering  and staging  waterfowl  populations.

Lower James  River,  Virginia  The  Lower James  River  Focus  Area  encompasses  445,277 hectares  (1,100,299 acres)  and  includes  the  James  River  and  it’s  tributaries from  its  mouth  in  the  Chesapeake  Bay  to  the non-tidal   fall line  near  Richmond  Virginia.    It  includes  the  Nanesmond   River,  the  Chickahominy River, the  Appomattox River  and  other  tributaries.  The  area  is known  for its extensive  brackish  and  freshwater tidal  marshes  along the expanse of the river.  Extensive  freshwater  wetlands  are found adjacent to tributary streams,  and beaver ponds abound  in the vicinity.  The area is highly developed, intermixed with low-density

rural  sites.  Agricultural row-crops are giving way to development and  planting of loblolly pine plantations. The vast  majority of land in this watershed  is in private  ownership.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service own the James River/Presquile National  Wildlife Refuge.  The federal government also owns other lands including Fort  Eustis  Military  Reservation and Jamestown Island National  Historic Site.  The Virginia Department of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries  owns three  sites,  The  Chickahominy Wildlife Management Area  (WMA),  Hog Island WMA, and Ragged Island WMA, each which have a large component of wetland  habitat. Dutch  Gap Conservation Area is owned and managed  by Chesterfield  County.  The Virginia Department of Conservation and  Recreation owns Chippokes  Plantation State  Park.   A few large historic  farms  in private  or corporate ownership  provide  the  most  area  on private  land  managed  for waterfowl.  Conservation Recommendations: Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this  area  retain its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior  converted  crop fields that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these sites will help wintering  and  staging  waterfowl  populations. Restoration of streamside  riparian buffers will improve  water quality  in the James  River and the Chesapeake  Bay.  Exotic  invasives,  such as Phragmites are continuing  to gain a foothold  in the area,  and treatment of these sites needs to be continued.

Rappahannock  River,  Virginia  The  Rappahannock River  Focus  Area  is located  in  east-central  Virginia covering portions  of the Counties  of Richmond,  Lancaster, King George, Spotsylvania, Essex, and Middlesex. Encompassing  299,296 hectares  (739,575 acres), the Lower Rappahannock Valley is within the Coastal  Plain Province.  Much of the land surrounding the Rappahannock River is in agricultural use.  Major components of this land use type include cropland  and to a much lesser degree, pastureland. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (USFWS)  have  an  active  acquisition  effort  to  purchase  property for the  Eastern Virginia  Rivers National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR)  Complex in this  focus area.  The  USFWS  is currently purchasing fee title and easements  on a series of properties  within  their  acquisition  boundary. These tracts are not contiguous, but  are acquired  based  on their  value to wildlife.  The  Virginia  Department  of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries own two properties, Lands  End  Wildlife Management Area,  which is managed  as a waterfowl  refuge, and Pettigrew Wildlife Management Area.  Fort  A.P.  Hill Military  installation is also located  in this focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these  areas.   Continued restoration of these  sites will help wintering  and  staging  waterfowl  populations. The use of Department of Agriculture conservation programs  will help install  needed buffers.

Roanoke  River,  Virginia  The  Roanoke  River  Focus  Area  includes  656,490 hectare  (1,622,215 acres)  and  is located  in south-central Virginia  covering portions  of the  Counties  of Campbell,  Charlotte, Halifax,  Meck­ lenburg,  and  Pittsylvania.  The  area  contains  the  Kerr  Reservoir,  which  is a United  States  Army  Corps

of Engineers  ﬂood protection project.   This  area  remains  relatively  undeveloped,  and  current  development is slow.  Two  major  river  systems,  The  Roanoke  and  the  Dan,  feed into  John  H. Kerr  Reservoir.   These rivers are characterized by wide ﬂoodplains  currently utilized  for agricultural or forest product production. Historically,  these  ﬂoodplains  were dominated by large expanses  of bottomland hardwood  forest.  The  ma­ jority  of land  in this  focal area  is in private  ownership.   The  United  States  Army  Corps  of Engineers  owns several  tracts of land  adjacent to Kerr  Reservoir.   The  Virginia  Department of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries have one wildlife management area  (Dick Cross Wildlife Management Area)  and  The  Virginia  Department of Conservation and Recreation owns two State  parks  in the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these  areas.   Continued restoration of these  sites will help wintering  and  staging  waterfowl  populations. United  States  Department of

Shenandoah River, Virginia The Shenandoah River Planning Area is located  in northwest Virginia covering

848,291 hectares  (2,096,164  acres)  of the  Shenandoah River  Valley.   The  Shenandoah Valley  is extremely important to Virginia Waterfowl  populations due to its impact  on water  quality  concerns in the Chesapeake Bay.   The  Valley  is an  area  of intense  row crop  agriculture and  beef cattle  pastureland, ﬂowing directly into  the  Potomac River  and  the  Chesapeake  Bay.   The  area  is also known  for mass  poultry  production. Chicken  and  turkey  houses abound  in the  vicinity,  close to sources of cheap  feed.  Headwater wetlands  are very important to water  quality.  The nutrients and chemicals, which ﬂow into these sites, if not treated, can make their way over long distances,  and have impacts  far from the originating  source.  Habitat improvements conducted  in this  area  can have large, beneficial impacts  on Virginia’s waterfowl  populations. Much of the non-agricultural land surrounding the Valley is in public ownership.  The George Washington National  Forest borders the Focus Area on the west and the Shenandoah National  Park,  including the Appalachian National Scenic Trail,  borders  the  area  on the  East.   The  Virginia  Department of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries  own, Goshen-Little North  Mountain Wildlife Management area in the southern portion  of the Focus Area.  Of the agricultural lowlands,  essentially  all are in private  ownership.

Conservation Recommendations: Agricultural conservation groups are very active  in the region.  Continued utilization of programs  such  as Conservation Reserve  Enhancement Program (CREP), The  Conservation Reserve  Program (CRP), Environmental Quality  Incentives  Program (EQIP) and  others  will help  relieve pressure  to intensively  farm sites.  Private non-profit  groups such as Ducks Unlimited  and  The  Chesapeake

Bay  Foundation and  state  groups  such  and  the  Virginia  Department  of Game  and  Inland  Fisheries  and the  Virginia  Department of Conservation and  Recreation work with  landowners  in the  region  to  develop environmentally-friendly land management plans to alleviate  some of these problems.

Southeast Virginia, Virginia The Southeast Virginia Focus Area is located in portions  of the Counties/Cities of Virginia Beach, Chesapeake,  and Suffolk, excluding highly-developed  areas.  The area contains  The Great Dismal Swamp, Back Bay, The North  Landing River and Northwest River systems and encompasses 138,879 hectares  (343,176 acres).  This area is developing at a rapid  pace, in spite of zoning protections put  in place by the localities.  The large open water wetlands  of Back Bay were renowned in the 1960s for their abundance of submerged  aquatic  vegetation (SAV). Currently, the amounts  of SAV are greatly  reduced.  The reduction is believed  linked  to  water  quality  degradation linked  to  agricultural and  residential  runoff  to  Back  Bay. patchwork of land  is held for conservation purposes.   The  U.S. Fish  and  Wildlife Service has Great  Dismal Swamp, Back Bay, and Mackay Island National  Wildlife Refuges.  The State  of Virginia owns Princess  Anne Wildlife Management Area, False Cape State  Park,  and several dedicated Natural Area Preserves.  The City of Virginia  Beach  currently has  an  agricultural reserve  program,   which  purchases  development rights  on property, and  The  Nature  Conservancy  has an active  easement and  land  acquisition  program  on the North Landing River.  Although  these holdings seem impressive,  a large majority of the land in this focus area is in private  ownership.   This  land  is highly sought for development in one of the  fastest  growing regions on the east coast.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help  this  area  retain  its  usefulness  for migratory birds.   Prior  converted  crop  fields that are restored to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these sites will help wintering  and staging  waterfowl populations. Exotic and invasive species, such as Phragmites are continuing  to gain a foothold  in the  area,  and  treatment of these  sites needs to be continued.

Western   Bayshore,   Virginia  The  Western   Bayshore  Marshes  are  abundant tidal  brackish-water  systems similar  in character to the  bayside  marshes  of the  Eastern Shore.  They  include  Mobjack  Bay,  the  Guinea Marshes,  The  Piankatank River,  Fleets  Bay,  Dividing  Creek and  the  Great  Wicomico River.  The  marshes open directly  to the Chesapeake  Bay and take  their  character from the Bay.  The marshes  consist mainly of Spartina, Juncus,  and other salt tolerant species.  Total  waterfowl numbers  are modest in this area; however, these  are important habitats for black ducks and  other  species.  Development in this  area  is moderate, but increasing  as the demand  for waterfront property becomes more pronounced.  Local watermen depend  upon these  marshes  for a variety  of species utilized  for commercial  gain.   Adjacent lands  are  typically forested, intermixed with agricultural row-crops.  The focus area encompasses 161,150 hectares  (398,209 acres).  Public lands  in this  area  are very limited.   The  Virginia  Department  of Conservation and  Recreation owns a few

small natural area preserves in the focus area, including Dameron Marsh Natural Area Preserve.  The Virginia Institute of Marine Science owns a small tract of research land on the Dragon Run.  The Virginia Department of Forestry also owns a small parcel on Dragon  Run.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these sites will help wintering  and staging  waterfowl  populations.

York/Poquoson, Virginia  The  York/Poquoson Focus  Area  is located  in east-central Virginia  following the

York  River  up  to  and  containing   the  Mattaponi and  Pamunkey River  systems.    The  area  encompasses

473,472 hectares  (1,169,970 acres).  These systems  contain  significant acres of tidal  freshwater  and  brackish marsh,  emergent,  shrub-scrub, and forested wetalnds.  The Mattaponi and Pamunkey River systems  are key dabbling  duck  areas.   Both  river  systems  have  abundant tidal  gum swamps.   The  majority of land  in this focus area  is in private  ownership.   The  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service owns Plum  Tree  Island  National Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  The  Colonial  National  Historic  Park  is located  adjacent  to the  lower York River. The U.S. Naval Weapons  Station, Cheatham Annex and Camp  Peary  Naval Reservation are also all located on the  lower York.  The  Virginia  Department of Conservation and  Recreation owns York River State  Park, as well as several  natural areas  within  the  watershed.  Both  the  Mattaponi and  Pamunkey Indian  Tribes have  reservations within  the  focus area.   The  Virginia  Department of Forestry owns two properties  in the focus area.

Conservation Recommendations:  Continued acquisition  and  protection of land  in a series of conservation corridors  will help this area retain  its usefulness for migratory birds.  Prior-converted crop fields and farmed wetland  pasture that are restored  to wetland  habitat provide excellent waterfowl habitat and receive high use in these areas.  Continued restoration of these sites will help wintering  and staging  waterfowl  populations.

Allegheny Highlands,  West  Virginia Canaan  Valley, the major component of the Allegheny Highlands  Plan­ ning Area, contains  the largest  wetland  area in West  Virginia,  making  up 39% of the state’s  wetlands.  The total  planning  area  encompasses  24,974 hectares  (61,713 acres).   It  contains  the  one of the  largest  shrub swamp  and  bog complexes  in the  eastern  United  States.   With  an  average  elevation  of 975 meters  (3,200 feet) above sea level and  a 14,164 hectares  (35,000 acres)  watershed, Canaan  Valley is the  highest  valley of its  size east  of the  Rocky  Mountains.  There  are  9,712 hectares  (24,000 acres)  identified  for protection in the  Canaan  Valley alone for this  planning  area.   Currently 6,169 hectares  (15, 245 acres)  are protected on the  Canaan  Valley National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR).  This  includes 2,245 hectares  (5,549 acres)  of wetland habitat. The wetlands  include those in the valley proper and numerous  perched wetlands,  springs and beaver ponds  in the  uplands  surrounding the  valley.   There  are  currently 3,543 hectares  (8,755 acres)  within  the

refuge acquisition  boundary owned by either  large power companies or private  individuals.  Almost all of the wetlands  and riparian habitat in Preston and Randolph Counties  is privately owned.

Conservation Recommendations:  Opportunities  for habitat restoration and  preservation are  numerous  in the Allegheny Highlands  Planning Area.  Partnerships with private  landowners  and businesses could address wetland  protection and water quality issues. Other actions could include eliminating  ditches for agriculture in wet meadows to restore  the natural hydrology  of the area and enhance  wetland  values.  Reforestation could occur  in logged upland  areas  of the  surrounding watershed  to  prevent  erosion  and  reestablish  red  spruce and  northern hardwood  forest  communities.  Extensive  work is required  to reestablish  historic  water  ﬂows throughout the  Canaan  Valley where  they  have  been  interrupted and  diverted  through road  construction and ATV damage.  The remaining  privately-owned land with the Canaan  Valley NWR acquisition  boundary should be purchased. Specific wetlands  along with suﬃcient upland  buffer should be acquired  in Randolph and  Preston counties.    Riparian habitat  along  the  Tygart Valley  River  in  Randolph County should  be protected through acquisition  or easement.

Eastern Panhandle, West  Virginia  The  planning  area,  approximately 197,567 hectares  (488,197 acres)  is made  up  of the  three  easternmost counties  in  West  Virginia,  Berkeley,  Jefferson  and  Morgan  bordering the  Potomac River  to  the  north  and  the  Shenandoah River  to  the  east.   These  large rivers  in addition  to numerous spring fed streams  and wetlands interspersed in an area dominated by agriculture provide abundant productive habitat for many  species including  waterfowl.   The  ownership  pattern in the  region  is federal, state,  county and town.  The majority of property in the region is privately owned.  The region is dominated by agriculture and possesses some of the  best  farmland  in West  Virginia.  Orchards, grain crops, cattle  and horses are all raised in the  region.  Conservation Recommendations: Disturbances to wintering  populations need to be minimized  or eliminated  entirely,  especially in riparian areas  and  around  wetlands.   This  can be accomplished  by acquiring  conservation easements  and/or excluding livestock from sensitive  habitats.

Meadow River, Virginia This planning  area encompasses  360,558 hectares  (890,955 acres) of Greenbrier  and Summers  Counties  in southeastern West  Virginia.  The  planning  area  includes the  Meadow River  wetlands which  is West  Virginia’s  second  largest  contiguous  wetland  complex  making  up  8% of the  state’s  total nonchannel  wetland  acres.  The  area  seasonally  ﬂoods providing  excellent waterfowl  nesting  and  migratory habitat and is a wintering  area for black duck when not frozen.  Additionally, the area’s unique hydrological situation provides varied palustrine-emergent systems to numerous  game and nongame species both resident and  migratory. Also included  in this  planning  area are portions  of the New and  Greenbrier  River corridors and Bluestone  Lake.  These rivers and their riparian zones are very important to wintering  waterfowl because they often have the only open water  in the area during  freezing weather.  Bluestone  Lake is part  of the mid­ winter  waterfowl survey in West  Virginia.  Total  waterfowl  counts  in this segment range from the 150 when much  of the  lake is frozen  to  over  1,000 in milder  weather.    Land  ownership  within  the  planning  area  is

American Black Duck Conservation Action Plan 



predominately private  including  both individual  and corporate holdings.  There  is also a significant amount of land  in public  ownership  including  portions  of the  focus areas.   The  West  Virginia  Division  of Natural Resources owns 1,009 hectares  (2,495 acres) in the Meadow River wetlands  complex.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  owns Bluestone  Lake and  the  National  Park  Service owns 24 hectares  (60 acres)  of riparian habitat and islands on the New River below Bluestone  Lake.

Conservation Recommendations: The  remaining  private  lands within  the  Meadow River wetlands  purchase area  boundary, both  wetlands  and  upland  buffer,  should  be purchased.  Prior  converted  wetlands  in the Meadow River area should be restored  once acquired.  Riparian habitat along the Greenbrier and New rivers should be protected and/or restored  by a combination of easements,  purchase,  and fencing.

Ohio  River  Valley,  West  Virginia  This  planning  area  consists  of the  islands  of the  Ohio  River,  the  back channels  and  riverine  habitats associated  with  these  islands,  and  adjacent wetland,  embayment and  bot­ tomland  habitat within  the  Ohio  River  ﬂoodplain  in West  Virginia.   The  planning  and  focus area  spans
450 kilometers  (280 miles) of the  Ohio River  corridor  and  includes  401,714 hectares  (992,653 acres).  Most of the  habitats within  this  area  have  been classified as Resource  Category  I under  the  United  States  Fish and  Wildlife Mitigation Policy.   This  area,  particularly the  islands,  back  channels,  and  embayments, have long been  recognized  by state,  federal,  and  private  organizations as having  high  quality  fish and  wildlife, recreational, scientific and natural heritage  value.  The majority of the Ohio River ﬂoodplain area is privately owned.  The  Ohio River  Islands  National  Wildlife Refuge (NWR),  established in 1990, protects 22 islands and  3 mainland  tracts totaling approximately 1,416 hectares  (3,500 acres)  of ﬂoodplain  habitats.  A total of 30 islands  are targeted for acquisition  or protection, and  over 809 hectares  (2,000 acres)  of embayments and wetlands  in West Virginia are identified for protection. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resource owns over 404 hectares  (1,000 acres) of lands and open water along the Ohio River at Green Bottom  Wetland Management Area.

Conservation Recommendations: Restoration of ﬂoodplain  wetlands  previously  altered  by agriculture; con­ servation  easements  or acquisition  of embayments and other  important riparian habitats; continued  acquisi­ tion of islands; reduction of non-point source pollution  loading which affects aquatic  bed habitat; minimiza­ tion of dredging  and spoil disposal in productive wetland  habitats.

APPENDIX B:  Habitat management  goals and needs for  the Eastern Habitat Joint Venture planning area.

Black  ducks  are  a  cornerstone species  for  the  Eastern Habitat Joint Venture   (EHJV) with  95% of the continental population breeding within the EHJV. The EHJV has established a goal of growing the black duck breeding  population from 272,524 indicated  breeding  pairs (IBP)  to 363,000 IBP (33% increase).  Due to the vast geographic area (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick,  Nova Scotia, Prince  Edward  Island,  Newfoundland, and  Labrador) covered  by the  EHJV  targeted conservation activities  will be focused in those  areas  where the  black duck response is expected  to be the  greatest and  where there  is the  greatest risk of future  loss of wetlands,  namely  the agricultural and coastal  areas of eastern  Canada. Given ongoing wetland  degradation and loss it is essential that conservation actions,  including policy development at the regional and provincial scale and local scale stewardship/extension programs,  focus on both habitat retention and restoration. Local stewardship/extension programs  are the  most costly and will be targeted to the  highest  priority  areas  with the  most  appropriate conservation actions.   The  EHJV  estimates  black  duck  restoration will require  the securement  of 40,582 acres  of wetland  and  39,591 acres  of associated  upland  habitat and  the  restoration of 14,520 wetland  and  13,601 upland  acres.  In addition, stewardship and  extension  activities  will inﬂuence
739,430 wetland  and  283,470 acres of associated  uplands.  Finally,  additional management activities  will be directed  towards  the 263,001 wetland  acres currently under  agreement.

A prioritization exercise  ensures  that activities  are  strategically focused toward  those  habitats that have the  greatest impact  on waterfowl  limiting  factors.   Habitat retention activities  will require  the  investment of $57.5M and  will secure 1,103,073 acres that will support 919,713 IBP  or 60% of population objectives. Over the course of this Implementation Plan  the habitat restoration program  is expected  to enhance  28,121 acres at  a cost of $23.2M. The  restoration of 14,520 wetland  acres is estimated to result  in habitat for an additional 17,943 IBP.

Key policy actions  for the EHJV  to achieve habitat goals:



1.  Maintain strong wetland  legislation in the Maritime  Provinces;  provide enhanced  legislative protection to  81,296 wetland  acres  in Prince  Edward  Island,  940,000 in New Brunswick,  and  948,370 acres  in Nova Scotia.

2.  Wetland policies are  developed  or enhanced  in Newfoundland  and  Labrador, Ontario, and  Quebec.

The  goal is to  help  develop  wetland  policies for Quebec’s  entire  wetland  base  estimated at  74.8M acres, develop wetland  policy for Newfoundland  and Labrador, and to enhance  protection of 500,000 acres of key wetland  habitat in southern Ontario.

3.  Promote policies that enhance  habitat  conservation in  the  industrial sectors  (agriculture,  forestry and  mining).   The  agriculture sector  will be inﬂuenced  through the  promotion  of biodiversity Best Management Practices (BMPs)  in current and future  Federal/Provincial  agricultural strategies while policy in the forest sector will involve a focus on BMPs  that benefit wetlands  and waterfowl.

4.  Promote valuation of natural capital  through the  development  of an Ecological Goods and  Services

(EG&S)  framework  beyond the initial  pilot projects  that EHJV  partners participated in.

APPENDIX C:  Habitat management  goals and needs in  the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Joint Venture planning area.

The  Upper  Mississippi  River  and  Great  Lakes  Joint Venture  (UMRGLJV) has  established a  black  duck breeding  population goal of 8,400 birds  and  estimates  the  current  population at  7,000 birds  (Soulliere  et a.   2007).   The  objective  of UMRGLJV is to  maintain regional  breeding  carrying  capacity  and  eliminate the  current  population deficit  through effective  and  eﬃcient  habitat conservation that  is considerate of other  species of concern.   The  UMRGLJV plans  to  obtain  their  breeding  population goal for black  ducks by maintaining (i.e.,  protecting) existing  breeding  habitat area  and  quality  at  sites  within  the  current or historic  range  (see Soulliere et al.  2007 for detailed  locations).  The  UMRGLJV intends  to improve  habitat for migrating and staging  black ducks.  A primary  information need for the UMRGLJV is to estimate  spring migration carrying  capacity.

APPENDIX E:  Habitat management  goals and needs in  the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture planning area.

The  Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture  (AMJV)  is a relatively  new JV  and  has  not  established  goals for the  black duck.  Appropriate goals and implementation plans need to be developed in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Migratory  Bird Management, the Black Duck Joint Venture, and the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils.  The AMJV region was originally included  in the Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture  region and important conservation areas  for black ducks are currently identified  in the ACJV  section (see APPENDIX A).

APPENDIX F:  Habitat management  goals and needs identiﬁed in the Chesapeake Bay Executive Order Strat­ egy  (Department  of Interior 2010).

Goal:  Restore  a three-year running  average  wintering  black duck population in the Chesapeake  Bay Water­

shed of 100,000 birds by 2025.


Conservation Recommendations:  Target  wetlands  and  adjacent uplands  for  protection, restoration, and enhancement to increase the energetic carrying  capacity  of the Chesapeake  Bay to support a wintering  pop­ ulation  of 100,000 black ducks.  Partners will develop an adaptive framework  to guide habitat management decisions  related  to  restoration and  enhancement at  the  local scale by  2013.  By 2017, National  Wildlife Refuges will increase  the  availability of food resources  on refuge lands  by 10%.  This  will be accomplished through active wetland  restoration and management, habitat protection, invasive species control,  and poten­ tial  expansion  of refuges.  The  Atlantic Coast  Joint Venture, Black Duck Joint Venture  and  other  partners are examining  the total  acreage of forage habitat needed to support a wintering  population of 100,000 black ducks.
