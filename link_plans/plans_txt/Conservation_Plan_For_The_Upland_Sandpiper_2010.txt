EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) is a medium-size shorebird that breeds in northwestern and central North America and migrates to southern South America in the nonbreeding season (Figure 1). Upland Sandpipers do not aggregate in large concentrations in their breeding range, and are even more dispersed on their nonbreeding grounds, which presents research and conservation efforts with the additional challenge of working at a landscape scale
throughout the species’ range.

[blue] distribution (based on Ridgely et al. 2003).


Although the Upland Sandpiper has a substantial global population that has been increasing since 1966 (350,000+ individuals), it is clear that the species was once much more numerous. Upland Sandpipers are currently most abundant in the upper Midwest—however, this is a region where there is continued loss of natural grasslands to row-crop agriculture.



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                         1
Substantial population decreases have occurred in the Canadian prairie provinces, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, and along the St. Lawrence River (in New York and Ontario). There are concerns, in general, about ongoing habitat loss and degradation in both North and South America, as well as about the effects of agrochemicals.
In their breeding range, Upland Sandpipers seem to prefer large (100 hectares or more) grassland-associated landscapes that offer a mix of vegetation heights, including short grass areas for courtship displays as well as taller grasses for nesting cover. On migration and nonbreeding grounds, Upland Sandpipers will use a variety of habitats, from natural grasslands
to cultivated or grazed fields. Grassland management and agricultural and grazing practices have the potential to greatly affect this species, either positively or negatively, throughout its range.


Major threats to this species include:

•   loss and degradation of habitat, including its composition, on breeding and nonbreeding grounds;
•   use of agrochemicals on breeding and nonbreeding grounds; and

•   loss or degradation of critical stopover habitat.



Conservation actions recommended to address these threats include:

•   protecting high-quality, heterogeneous breeding habitat by, for example, creating incentives for ranchers to maintain grassland and range habitat;
•   conducting research to determine potential effects of agrochemicals, in both North and South America; and
•   identifying critical stopover habitat and determining its condition;

RESUMEN EJECUTIVO

El Bartramia longicauda es un ave playera de tamaño medio que se reproduce en el noroeste y centro de Norte América y migra hacia el sur de Suramérica en la temporada de no reproducción (Figura 1). Los Bartramia longicauda no se agregan en grandes concentraciones en su rango de reproducción y aun están más dispersos en sus áreas de no reproducción. Esta característica presenta los esfuerzos de la investigación y de conservación con el desafío
adicional de trabajo a escala de paisaje en todo el rango de la especie.

embargo ~sta es una regi~n donde hay una p~rdida constante de pastizales naturales por la agricultura extensiva (los cultivos en hileras).
Las disminuciones sustanciales de la poblaci~n se ha ocurrido en las provincias de las praderas de Canada, los estados de Wisconsin y Michigan, la Provincia de Ontario, y a lo largo del Río San Lorenzo (en Nueva York y Ontario). En general existe la preocupaci~n sobre la perdida y degradaci~n continua de habitat en el Norte Am~rica y Suram~rica, ademas sobre los efectos de agroquímicos.
En su rango de reproducci~n, los Bartramia longicauda prefieren paisajes grandes (100 hectareas o mas) y asociados con pastizales, que ofrecen una mezcla de alturas en su vegetaci~n, incluyendo areas de hierba corta para el cortejo, así como los de hierba alta para la anidaci~n. En los areas de migraci~n y no reproducci~n, los Bartramia longicauda usan una gran variedad de habitats, desde pastizales naturales a zonas cultivadas o de pastoreo. El manejo de
las praderas y las practicas agrícolas y el pastoreo tienen la potencial de afectar en gran medida a esta especie, tanto positiva como negativamente, en toda su rango.


Las principales amenazas para esta especie incluyen:

•    La p~rdida y degradaci~n de habitats, incluyendo su composici~n, en las areas de 

reproducci~n y no reproducci~n; 

•  El uso de agroquímicos en zonas de reproducci~n y no reproducci~n; y

•  La p~rdida y/o degradaci~n de habitat crítico en los sitios de paradas de la migraci~n.





Las acciones de conservación recomendadas para hacer frente a las amenazas incluyen:

•  Proteger el habitat heterog~neo de alta prioridad en las zonas de reproducci~n, por la creaci~n de incentivos para ganaderos en mantener los habitats de praderas y pastizales, por ejemplo;
•  Conducir las investigaciones para determinar los posibles efectos de los agroquímicos tanto en Norteam~rica como Suram~rica; y
•  Identificar los habitats críticos en los sitios de paradas y determinar su condici~n.

PURPOSE


The purpose of this conservation plan is to define the current conservation status of the Upland Sandpiper, understand its ecological requirements throughout the year, identify threats that affect the species and, thereby, recommend the most efficient conservation actions that can be taken to ensure its continued recovery. Because the Upland Sandpiper makes such long- distance migrations, this species faces a special suite of challenges on the breeding and nonbreeding grounds, and during migration. Agricultural changes in North and South America, as well as widespread use of agrochemicals, appear to pose substantial threats.



STATUS AND NATURAL HISTORY


The Upland Sandpiper has been extensively studied on the breeding grounds in North America, and its habitat preferences have been particularly well documented. However, major gaps remain in understanding Upland Sandpiper demography and genetic variation between breeding populations. Very little is known about the Upland Sandpiper’s migration, either as it flies to South America for the nonbreeding season or as it flies north to reach its breeding areas. There is only a limited, non-quantitative understanding of habitat use and movements on the nonbreeding grounds. This is a critical research need to fill. Also, it is unclear to what degree use of agrochemicals affects Upland Sandpipers on their breeding and nonbreeding grounds.

MORPHOLOGY

The Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) is a monotypic, medium-size shorebird that is closely related to curlews (Numenius spp.) (Sibley and Monroe 1990). Its overall length is
280 to 320 millimeters. Males have a mass of 135 grams (range of 112-179 grams [n = 258]); females’ mass is 168 grams (range of 121–246 grams [n = 237]. Females greater than 200 grams are invariably gravid 26 grams (Hayman et al. 1986, Morrison et al. 2001, Sandercock, unpubl. data).


TAXONOMY

Although there is no evidence of separate races, there is a small decrease in the average size of Upland Sandpipers across North America, from west to east (Hayman et al. 1986). There



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                         5
appear to be three discrete breeding populations that have little or no overlap, although this needs further study. Upland Sandpiper breeding east of the Appalachian Mountains may be separate from the main population that occurs from Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois west through the Great Plains to Alberta, Canada. There is a separate breeding population in central Alaska and
Canada’s Yukon Territory. It is unclear whether isolated breeding populations in Washington and Oregon represent dispersal from the Great Plains population. This species spends the austral spring-summer (November to March) in grasslands, pastures, and agricultural lands from southern Brazil and Paraguay to Uruguay and central Argentina.


POPULATION ESTIMATE AND TREND

The global population estimate of Upland Sandpipers is approximately 350,000 individuals (Morrison et al. 2001; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). This estimate includes the calculation of approximately 10,000 individuals in Canada (Morrison et al. 2001). Houston and Bowen (2001) extrapolated from U.S. state estimates to generate a continental population total of 1,142,000 individuals, which is probably high and should be treated with caution. However, estimates of approximately 198,000 (95% C.I. 138,313–258,021) individuals in North Dakota in 1993 (Igl and Johnson 1997) and more than 175,000 in Illinois in 1958 (Graber and Graber 1963) seem to indicate that the estimate of 350,000 may be conservative. At present, there are fewer than 1,000 Upland Sandpipers in Illinois (J. Herkert, pers. comm.). This issue warrants further investigation and analysis.
There are no population estimates for the Upland Sandpiper during the nonbreeding season in South America, except for Paraguay, where the species’ nonbreeding population was recently estimated to be approximately 5,000 birds (H. del Castillo in litt.).
The Upland Sandpiper’s population trend has increased across its entire breeding range by 1.4% annually during the period 1966–2005 (P = 0.035) (Sauer et al. 2008) (Figure 2). However, Houston and Bowen (2001) point out that there were substantial population declines in the late 19th Century, when more than 50,000 Upland Sandpipers were shot annually for food. It
is not possible to quantify this decline, but it seems unlikely that more recent increases this

century have restored populations to historic levels.

Figure 2. The Upland Sandpiper population trend increased by 1.4% annually across its entire range in North America during the period 1966–2005 (P = 0.035)(Sauer et al. 2008).



Population declines were noted by Houston and Bowen (2001) and were reported in Argentina (Bucher and Nores 1988), particularly for Buenos Aires (White 1988, in Houston and Bowen 2001; Narosky and Di Giacomo 1993), C~rdoba (Miatello et al. 1999, R. Miatello pers. comm.), and Santa Fe Provinces (M. De La Peña in litt.). In Uruguay, the species used to be abundant in the 1800s (Cuello and Gerzenstein 1962).
Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data indicate a significant increase in central North America in recent decades (Droege and Sauer 1990, Sauer and Droege 1992), but no significant
population change for eastern North America in recent decades (Sauer and Droege 1992). However, a decline is evident based on data from 1980–1989, and large declines have occurred in parts of northeastern United States (Carter 1992) (Figure 3). Range-wide, areas exhibiting
increases outnumber those showing declines, and the continental BBS trend for the period 1966–

2005 was positive (Sauer et al. 2008). In the St. Lawrence Plains region, Upland Sandpipers have declined an average of 6.1% (P < 0.10) per year (BBS data: 1980–89, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Migratory Bird Management, unpubl. data, Laurel, Maryland), apparently as a result of reforestation and decreases in agriculture. The largest breeding population in the Northeast is increasing; it occurs on blueberry barrens in eastern Maine and New Brunswick, Canada, where there are probably more than 500 pairs (N. Famous, pers.


WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                         7
comm.). Upland Sandpipers are nearly extirpated as breeders from Rhode Island and Delaware. In Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, the largest breeding densities are
restricted to airports (Carter 1992).





























Figure 3.  According to the percent change (-/+) per year, Upland Sandpiper population trends have increased substantially [dark blue] in the core of its range (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas) since 1966. It also has increased in Maine and Quebec. Substantial decreases [red] have occurred in the Canadian prairie provinces, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, and along the St. Lawrence River in New York and Ontario (Sauer et al. 2008).



Bart et al. (2007) analyzed International Shorebird Survey (ISS) and Maritimes Shorebird Survey data from Atlantic Canada and the northeastern Unites States, and found an annual declining trend of 0.94 (P-value < 0.05); the same analysis for the Midwest found no significant trend.

DISTRIBUTION

Breeding Season
Upland Sandpiper distribution during the breeding season extends from the mixed grass prairie provinces in southern-central Canada (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta) to North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, east of the Rocky Mountains in



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                         8
Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado south to northern Oklahoma and northwestern Missouri (Houston and Bowen 2001) (Figure 1). The Upland Sandpiper is generally rare and locally distributed in the eastern United States (Indiana to Maine, south to Virginia) and in eastern Canada, although this species has expanded its range and increased in numbers in certain areas (Figure 1). In Quebec, the Upland Sandpiper expanded to the northeast between 1970 and 1986 (Falardeau and DesGranges 1991), and has become more abundant on blueberry barrens in eastern Maine (Shriver et al. 2005) and in New Brunswick (Figure 4). The Upland Sandpiper also breeds discontinuously in central Alaska and Yukon Territory, rarely in British Columbia, and eastern Oregon (Houston and Bowen 2001) (Figure 1).
The upper Great Plains region supports nearly 70% of the Upland Sandpiper breeding population; South Dakota has approximately 34% of the global population, followed by North Dakota (19%), Nebraska (15%), and Kansas (11%) (Wells and Rosenberg 1999) (Figure 4). The Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), which provides an estimate of the numbers of individuals per route, is useful in determining Upland Sandpiper relative density. The BBS confirms that the Great Plains states have the highest mean numbers of Upland Sandpiper per BBS route: South Dakota (16.1), North Dakota (9.3), Nebraska (7.4), and Kansas (5.3) (Sauer et al. 2008). Lower densities were found on BBS routes in the Canadian prairie provinces, with an average of 1.9 individuals per route in Manitoba, 0.9 in Saskatchewan, and 0.6 in Alberta (Sauer et al. 2008,
Houston and Bowen 2001).

Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas (Sauer et al. 2008).

Nonbreeding Season
During the nonbreeding season, the Upland Sandpiper has a very broad distribution, passing through many countries in South America, with the exception of Chile (Houston and Bowen 2001, Birdlife International 2006). The species’ primary nonbreeding range is restricted to northeastern Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, Paraguay, and eastern Bolivia (Figure 5). The species occurs most frequently on the Pampas and on the northern part of the Espinal ecoregion in Argentina, and on the Campos of Uruguay and southern Brazil (Figure 5). In the Pampas of Argentina, Upland Sandpipers are concentrated mainly on the rolling, inland, and southern Pampas, where the landscape is presently covered by crops such as wheat, linseed,
sunflower, maize, soybean, and sorghum (Blanco et al. 1993, 2004) (Figures 5 and 6).

Upland Sandpiper distribution in Central and South America: A) primary nonbreeding range [red] and passage range [green] (according to Ridgely et al. 2003); and B) detail with the subregions of the Rio de La Plata grasslands (Soriano 1991) wherein A = Rolling Pampa, B = Inland Pampa, C = Southern Pampa, D = Flooding Pampa, E = Mesopotamic Pampa, F = Southern Campos, and G = Northern Campos.



In Uruguay, Upland Sandpipers once had a broad distribution. At present, they appear to be concentrated in the northeastern part of the country, especially in native grasslands along the Uruguay River, where the largest numbers have been recorded in the past 10 years (A. Azpiroz in litt., J. Aldabe in litt.) (Figure 6). In Paraguay, the species has a broad distribution; small
numbers are primarily recorded during southbound migration (Guyra Paraguay 2006) (Figure 6).

Data from Brazil and Bolivia are limited, and available records mainly correspond to migration

seasons (Figure 6).

Several authors have suggested that a small population of Upland Sandpipers “winters” in northern South American countries such as Suriname (Haverschmidt 1966), French Guyana (N. Delelis in litt.), Venezuela (Hilty 2003) and the Orinoco basin of eastern Colombia, where the species has been regularly observed in January (L.G. Olarte, pers. comm.). According to Haverschmidt (1966), these sandpipers spend the entire nonbreeding season in Suriname, where small flocks have been observed from late August to mid- to late-April.

MIGRATION

Northbound
The northbound migration proceeds from Argentina in February and continues through March, with some birds remaining until April (Hudson 1923). In C~rdoba Province, the northbound migration takes place from early March to late April (R. Miatello in litt.), where recent observations of thousands of birds passing through Miramar City suggest the existence of an important migratory corridor (P. Michelutti in litt.). Some northbound individuals reach Ecuador by 30 March or Chiapas, Mexico, by 29 March [in Mexico, the species is mostly absent from the Yucatan Peninsula and the Northwest (Figure 1)]. From Mexico, most migrants proceed north via central Texas, Kansas, and Mississippi, with smaller numbers occurring farther west
and east of that geographic span (Houston and Bowen 2001). Early arrivals were reported reaching four localities in Texas during 5–13 March (Bent 1929).
The peak spring migration in North America passes through Texas in late March (formerly up to 1,000 birds at Corpus Christi); Oklahoma in early April (400 birds at Norman); and Kansas from late March to early April (B. Sandercock, pers. comm.). In Nebraska’s Platte River valley, the main migration occurs between 24 April and 10 May (Faanes and Lingle 1995). In North Dakota, birds arrive in early May (139 at Minot) (Skagen et al. 1999); in Minnesota’s Mahnomen County, they arrive during 1–6 May (Lindmeier 1960). Further east, migrants usually arrive in western Pennsylvania after 20 April (Wilhelm 1995), and in New Jersey (Walsh et al.
1999) and Maine from mid-April through mid-May. In Alaska, they generally appear in mid- May.

Southbound
Little is known about the extent of over-water flights, or about what proportion of the population moves south through the Americas versus directly to South America. Upland Sandpipers are more numerous along the Atlantic Coast during the southbound migration than during the northbound (Veit and Petersen 1993). The species is generally rare in Florida and the West Indies (Raffaele et al. 1998).
In North America, the southbound migration takes place from mid-July to mid-August, starting earlier in more northern latitudes. In Oklahoma, numbers peak in late July; in northern Texas, the first half of August (Skagen et al. 1999). Farther east, most have departed Quebec, Canada, and Maine by late August (Yank and Breton 1996, P. D. Vickery pers. obs). In Jalisco,

Mexico, migrants were recorded between 1 August and 29 September, with maximum counts of

153 and 135 individuals on 17 and 21 August, respectively (O. Reyna pers. comm., Houston and

Bowen 2001).

In South America, the Upland Sandpiper southern migration is mainly through the High Andes and, secondarily, through the Orinoco Basin in Colombia (L.G. Naranjo in litt.). There are some records for the eastern llanos in Venezuela (V. Peña in litt.) and the Cordillera of Popayan in Colombia (L.G. Naranjo in litt.). In Ecuador, the earliest record is 10 August in Carapungo (Bent 1929); in northeastern Argentina, the earliest are 25 and 30 August for Formosa and Corrientes Provinces, respectively (J.R. Contreras and A.S. Di Giacomo pers. comm.).
In the Central Andes of Ecuador, hundreds of Upland Sandpipers are found dead each year in September, during the southbound migration. This phenomenon, well-known by local people, occurs at the Atillo and Ozogoche Lagoons—more than 3,000 meters above sea level. Its extent has not been studied, however, and it is not known if there is similar mortality in other Andean wetlands. Harsh weather and poor body condition appear to be potential causes (S. Lasso in litt., T. Santander in litt., R. Clay in litt.).
The migration of Upland Sandpipers continues southbound along the Central Brazil Flyway (Antas 1983) and across Paraguay, where small numbers remain during the whole nonbreeding season (H. del Castillo in litt.). The species reaches Argentina’s Formosa and Corrientes Provinces by late August (A.S. Di Giacomo and J.R. Contreras pers. comm., in Houston and Bowen 2001); the sierras in C~rdoba Province by late September (M. Nores in P. Michelutti in litt.); and Salto in northern Buenos Aires Province by 11 October (A.S. Di Giacomo pers. comm., in Houston and Bowen 2001; A.G. Di Giacomo in litt.). It arrives at Uruguay’s Artigas Department by 16 October (Venzal et al. in press).



MAJOR HABITATS

Breeding Range
Nesting Upland Sandpipers are restricted primarily to extensive, open tracts of short grassland habitat. They occur, for example, in native prairies, dry meadows, pastures, domestic hayfields, short-grass savannas, plowed fields, along highway rights-of-way, and on airfields; in Alaska, they use scattered woodlands and scree slopes at or above timberline (Forbush 1925, Higgins et al. 1969, AOU 1983, Osborne and Peterson 1984). Nesting also occurs in dry patches


WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       13
of wet meadows (Stewart 1975, Herman et al. 1984) and in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) barrens (Vickery et al. 1994, 1999). It should be noted that this species does not breed in large, concentrated colonies; instead, it tends to be widely distributed across its breeding range, occurring in loose aggregations.
The size of the grassland habitat appears to be critical to the Upland Sandpiper, at least in the central part of its range. In Kansas, Mong (2005) found that some individual sandpipers had home ranges of more than 200 hectares. In Maine, Vickery et al. (1994) found that Upland Sandpipers preferred larger sites (greater than 200 hectares) and rarely occupied patches less
than 50 hectares.

Heterogeneity appears to be an important component of Upland Sandpiper breeding habitat. Studies in Wisconsin (Ailes 1980), Illinois (Buhnerkempe and Westmeier 1988), and Maine (Vickery et al. 1994, 1999) document that sandpipers avoid uniform vegetation, such as tall grasses, and generally prefer areas that provide patchy micro-sites with a variety of vegetation heights. In North Dakota and Maine, Upland Sandpipers preferred sites that had been recently disturbed by prescribed fire (Kirsch and Higgins 1976, Vickery et al. 1999). Upland Sandpipers also have large minimum-area requirements, generally selecting grasslands sites that are larger than 100 hectares for breeding (Herkert 1994, Vickery et al. 1994). Optimal breeding habitat contains a mixture of short grass (10–20 centimeters) areas for feeding and courtship, interspersed with taller grasses and forbs for nesting and brood cover (Kirsch and Higgins 1976, Ailes 1980). Having the preferred height and density of grasses in nesting and feeding areas permits adults and chicks to move through the vegetation easily. In Wisconsin, Upland Sandpipers preferred a level topography with a minimum of tall vegetation edges (White 1983). In many eastern states, airports support the majority of nesting Upland Sandpipers, including
74% of all Upland Sandpipers observed in Ohio (Osborne and Peterson 1984).

Agricultural land-use patterns and farming practices influence the choice of nesting sites. In central Wisconsin, Ailes (1980) found that idle fields and hayfields accounted for the majority of nesting habitats. In North and South Dakota, the majority of nests were found in ungrazed grasslands of medium density with abundant ground litter (Higgins et al. 1969). A 5-year survey (1969–74) of intensively cultivated areas in the Prairie Pothole Region of east-central North Dakota recorded 57% of nests in untilled habitats, which comprised only 7% of the total study area (Higgins 1975). In North Dakota, Kirsch and Higgins (1976) recorded lowest mean nest



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       14
densities in annually tilled croplands and highest mean nest densities in native grasslands the second season after a prescribed burn. Seeded grass/legume mixtures generally grew too tall and dense to support Upland Sandpipers. Kirsch and Higgins (1976) found that the majority of North Dakota nests were located in either thin, uniform vegetative cover or in scattered clumps of fairly dense cover characterized by standing stubble fields, moderately grazed pastures, mowed areas with heavy regrowth, brush clumps with some understory vegetation, and undisturbed vegetation on poor soils. In Illinois, Buhnerkempe and Westemeir (1988) reported that sandpipers selected stands of grass and forbs for nesting and avoided fields of uniform grass and legumes.
Upland Sandpipers use grassy areas of low vegetation height for feeding and brood rearing. In Wisconsin, Ailes (1980) observed 66% of adults with young in heavily grazed pastures, 13% in ungrazed pastures, and 11% in hayfields. In Illinois, Buhnerkempe and Westemeir (1988) reported that Upland Sandpipers selected brood-rearing habitats of wheat stubble fields, recently hayed legumes, old redtop meadows (Agrostis spp.), and moderately grazed pastures. A South Dakota grasslands management study revealed that habitat use was highest in recently burned fields with short, open, new growth and no litter or old growth (Huber and Steuter 1984).
In Quebec, Upland Sandpipers use large peatlands (greater than 160 hectares) (Calm~ and Haddad 1996). In Maine, large numbers of sandpipers nest in commercial blueberry barrens that are mowed and burned biennially (Vickery et al. 1999). In Illinois, Upland Sandpipers preferred nesting in fields 1 to 2 years post-burn (Buhnerkempe and Westemeier 1988), but were absent 3 years post-burn (Herkert 1994).
Burning appears to be helpful to Upland Sandpipers by providing greater invertebrate abundance, which is likely to benefit young birds. Kirsch (1974) reported gross increases in insect life, especially grasshoppers (Orthoptera), on burned grasslands in North Dakota. Similarly, Queal (1973) noted a greater variety of small insects on burned grasslands in Kansas.
In two studies in the Dakotas, apparent nest success was lower (32% versus 53%) on grazed fields than on idle land (Kantrud and Higgins 1992), and lower on grazed land (48%) than on undisturbed grassland (71%) or on grassland burned twice during the 5-year study (71%) (Kirsch and Higgins 1976). However, in south-central North Dakota, Messmer (1985) found highest nest density and nest success on the twice-over deferred grazing rotation system and on season-long grazing pasture. There were no nests in idle, ungrazed fields until they were mowed



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       15
(Messmer 1990). In another study in North Dakota, nest success showed little response to grazing (Kantrud 1981). In Saskatchewan, Upland Sandpipers only nested in grazed pastures (Dale 1984). Grazing cattle should be restricted from nesting fields during the egg-laying and incubation periods, 1 May to 15 July. Annual grazing of native grasses may not be a suitable management method to control vegetational succession. In Wisconsin, light to moderate grazing did not control encroachment of woody species in natural grasslands. On the other hand, heavy, prolonged grazing can lead to destruction of desirable components of prairie vegetation (Tester and Marshall 1962).



Migration
•   North America

Upland Sandpiper generally use large plowed fields, mowed hayfields, and pastures for staging and stopover feeding sites. They also occur in dry salt-hay marshes. Upland Sandpiper densities in southern Texas were greatest in shrub-grass (0.38 per 10 hectares), compared to open grassland (0.06) and parkland (0.07) (Igl and Ballard 1999). In Mexico, Upland Sandpipers have been found in fields of harvested corn (Zea mays) and agave (Agave sp.), as well as in fields of flooded acacia (Acacia sp.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgar)(O. Reyna pers. comm., Houston and Bowen 2001).


•   South America

Information about Upland Sandpiper habitat use during migration in South America is scarce. Canevari et al. (2001) mention sandpiper use of the High Andes grasslands of Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador, and the deforested areas of rainforest on the Pacific side of Colombia. In Paraguay, the species was observed in natural grasslands, planted pastures, and agricultural lands (Guyra Paraguay 2004), and also has been observed in soybean fields (H. del Castillo in litt.). In Peru, Bolster and Robinson (1990) reported that this species used beach habitats overgrown with Tessaria and weeds along the Manu River.



Nonbreeding Range
In its nonbreeding range, Upland Sandpipers have adapted to a variety of human-disturbed habitats. Habitats used by this species include natural grasslands and grazed pastures (primarily by



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       16
cattle), open saline steppes, alfalfa fields (Medicago sativa), and other artificial pastures such as oat (Avena sp.) and Agropyron sp., as well as cultivated lands (plowed fields, wheat, soybean, maize, sunflower, and unflooded rice fields), where the species is mainly found in stubble fields (Blanco et al. 1993, 2004, 2006; Miatello et al. 1999, A. Azpiroz in litt., J. Aldabe in litt., I. Roesler in litt., P. Michelutti in litt.).
In the Pampas of Argentina, Upland Sandpipers are common in upland areas where more than 25% of lands are under cultivation; they are found mainly in tall vegetation fields where crops and ruderal plants dominate (Blanco et. al. 1993, 2004). In the inland Pampas, Upland Sandpipers inhabit crops and pastures, and appear to prefer wheat stubble fields (I. Roesler in litt.). Abundances in native pastures are similar to those in crops or artificial pastures like alfalfa, oat, and Agropyron sp. In Villegas (west of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina), this habitat is only available during December and January, as these fields are later used for soybean cultivation. Upland Sandpipers occupy soybean, maize, and sunflower fields when these plants are less than
20 centimeters tall (I. Roesler in litt.).

In Uruguay’s Salto and Paysandú Departments, Upland Sandpipers have been recorded in both natural and artificial grasslands, but abundances were significantly greater in natural grasslands grazed by cattle, sheep, or the native Pampas Deer (Ozotoceros bezoarcticus) (A. Azpiroz in litt., J. Aldabe in litt.). In Salto and Artigas Departments, Upland Sandpipers once inhabited grasslands having a mixture of short grass areas (5 centimeters; 80–90% of coverage) interspersed with taller grasses (30 centimeters; 10–20% of coverage) (J. Aldabe in litt.).


CONSERVATION STATUS

Birdlife International (2006) considers the Upland Sandpiper as “Not Threatened / Least Concern” status. In the United States, this species is considered to be one of National Conservation Concern by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2002), due to population declines during the last century. The U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001) (2004) lists Upland Sandpiper as a Species of High Concern (Category 4), based on scores for the six national shorebird prioritization variables. The species earned a “5” (the highest score) for the Population Trend variable because of “demonstrated declines,” and a “4” for the Threats During the Nonbreeding Season variable. These scores should probably be reviewed.





WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       17
This species is listed in the Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or Bonn Convention; United Nations Environment Programme 1979). This species also is listed as “Endangered” or “Threatened” in many states in the eastern United States (Vickery 1992, Houston and Bowen 2001), and is listed as “Endangered,” “Threatened,” or of “Special Concern” in five of eight Midwestern states (Herkert et al. 1996). In some South American countries, such as Paraguay and Brazil (State of Rio Grande do Sul), it is not considered threatened at the local level (Fontana et al. 2003, Guyra Paraguay 2004). In other South American countries, such as Argentina, the species is categorized as “Low Risk / Near Threatened” (García Fernandez et al. 1997); in Suriname, the species is “Fully Protected” and no exploitation is allowed (Jong and Spaans 1984).
Given that the Breeding Bird Survey has determined that Upland Sandpiper populations have increased annually across North America since 1966, this species does not appear to be in imminent danger across its breeding range. However, there are areas where Upland Sandpiper populations have decreased substantially, most notably in the Canadian Prairie provinces and southern Ontario; parts of the U.S. Midwest (Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan); and New York and other eastern states. Moreover, as Andres has pointed out (2007, in litt.), populations that have shown an increase have presumably been benefiting from the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). However, because Upland Sandpiper habitat created under the CRP is not permanent, there is continued concern about future losses.



POPULATION GOAL

The U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001) has set a target of 470,000 individuals as a population goal—an estimated return to the numbers present in the 1970s. If the species continues to increase annually at a rate of 1.4%, this target would be reached in 2016. Andres (2007, in litt.) suggests that a “no net loss” figure of holding at the current population size is more realistic. Given the population increases demonstrated in parts of its range, we recommend that the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan’s conservation ranks for this species be reviewed, and that the Population Trend variable be lowered from a rank of “5” (most severe category of decline) to a rank of “4.”







WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       18
CONSERVATION SITES


This portion of the plan identifies the main areas and key sites where 1% or more of the estimated population for the Upland Sandpiper can be found.


BREEDING SITES

The upper Great Plains Region of the United States (South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas) is critically important for the Upland Sandpiper, supporting nearly 70% of this species’ breeding population. In North Dakota, Upland Sandpipers breed in comparable
numbers on both private and public lands (L. Igl, pers. comm.). Eastern Maine and adjacent New Brunswick, Canada, appear to support substantial numbers of Upland Sandpipers, and should be thoroughly inventoried.
Spatial models have been applied to the Prairie Pothole Region to target landscapes for grassland conservation there (Niemuth et al. 2005) (Figure 7). For example, the spatial model used in producing Figure 7 predicted the probability (red = high; blue = low) of Upland Sandpiper presence in the Prairie Pothole portion of North Dakota in 1995. Models such as this one are empirically based, assess landscape context, and are designed to maximize the efficiency of conservation efforts. They often help to guide the use of Federal Duck Stamp revenue and North American Wetlands Conservation Act grant funds in the acquisition of grassland
easements.

MIGRATION SITES

Northbound
The agricultural lands in south Texas appear to be a major stopover region in spring. Beyond this, sites used by Upland Sandpipers during northbound migration are not well known and need to be identified.

Southbound
Sites used by Upland Sandpipers during southbound migration are either poorly known or not yet adequately identified. In September and October, numbers of Upland Sandpipers have been recorded at Iquitos, Peru (R. Westerduijn in F. Smith in litt.), and at two farms in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, Fazenda Sao Vicente and Fazenda Campinas (I. Serrano unpublished
data), suggesting these as potential conservation areas to be assessed. Given that the Upland Sandpiper’s southern migration is mainly through the High Andes, it should be a high priority to identify major stopover sites in this region.


NONBREEDING SITES

Because the Upland Sandpiper is widely dispersed during the nonbreeding season, rather than concentrated at particular areas, it is not possible to identify specific sites used by at least
1% of the species’ global population. Therefore, this criterion was not useful in identifying key sites for conservation.
As an alternative, we have delineated the Upland Sandpiper’s primary nonbreeding range into “Main” and “Secondary” distribution zones (Figure 8). To create these zones, we used the map adapted from Ridgely et al. (2003) (Figure 6) and available data on habitats, current land use, and Upland Sandpiper numbers and dates. We updated the species’ primary nonbreeding range accordingly and later divided it into a Main Nonbreeding Range and a Secondary Nonbreeding Range (Figure 8):
•   The Main Nonbreeding Range (MNR) encompasses the Río de La Plata Grasslands region (which includes the Pampas of Argentina and the Campos of Uruguay and southern Brazil), and the northern portion of the Espinal ecoregion in Argentina.
•   The Secondary Nonbreeding Range (SNR) encompasses northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, southwest Brazil, and eastern Bolivia.

Figure 8. Upland Sandpiper seasonality of records (A), and division of the nonbreeding range (B). The eight distribution zones of the Main Nonbreeding Range (MNR) are in tan and numbered accordingly:
I) Modified Espinal; II) Northern Campos; III) Southern Campos; IV) Inland Pampa; V) Rolling Pampa;
VI) Mesopotamic Pampa; VII) Flooding Pampa; and VIII) Southern Pampa. The Secondary Nonbreeding
Range (SNR) is based on Ridgely et al. (2003) and is indicated in blue.


The MNR localities are characterized by larger numbers of Upland Sandpipers observed during the austral summer months. The SNR localities generally have lower numbers, with the highest counts recorded during migration. For example, in Salto, Argentina (within the MNR), the species was recorded from October to March, and the highest counts occurred in December and January (Figures 8A and 9A, A.G. Di Giacomo in litt.). Conversely, data from Bahía de Asunci~n, Paraguay (within the SNR), clearly revealed that sightings and abundances of the





WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       21
species were higher during the period of southbound migration in October and November

(Figures 8A and 9B, Guyra Paraguay 2006).

The Upland Sandpiper MNR has been divided into eight zones based mainly on the Rio de la Plata Grasslands and the Ecoregions of Argentina maps (Soriano 1991, Administraci~n de Parques Nacionales 1999). These zones are: I) Modified Espinal; II) Northern Campos; III) Southern Campos; IV) Inland Pampa; V) Rolling Pampa; VI) Mesopotamic Pampa; VII) Flooding Pampa; and VIII) Southern Pampa (Table 1 [see Appendix], Figure 8).
Data on Upland Sandpiper abundances within the MNR are not consistent, but this species seems to be quite common in many sectors, where it is regularly observed in small groups. Records of large flocks are rare, and abundances per locality tend to be low (Table 1 [see Appendix]; Figure 10).

The largest numbers were recorded in Zone I (Modified Espinal), followed by Zones VIII (Southern Pampa), II (Northern Campos, particularly the northwest Uruguay sector), IV (Inland Pampa), and V (Rolling Pampa) (Tables 1 and 2 [see Appendix]). The maximum count of 1,265 birds was recorded at Mar Chiquita Lagoon, C~rdoba Province, Argentina (P. Michelutti in litt.). In the Inland Pampa, the species is regularly observed in small groups; the highest densities have been recorded in wheat stubble, where groups of five to 10 birds are common, sometimes in the same field (I. Roesler in litt.). Recent data from Uruguay suggest the importance of the Artigas and Salto Departments’ grasslands for this sandpiper, with densities of 1.18 to 1.34 individuals per kilometer of transect (J. Aldabe in litt.).
Smaller numbers were registered within the SNR and the migration range, with the highest counts in the austral spring months (Guyra Paraguay 2006, Belton 2000, R.A. Dias in litt., I. Accordi in litt.). A maximum record of 1,100 birds was recorded at Monte de Las Barrancas-Salinas Grandes (C~rdoba Province, Argentina) during the northbound migration (R. Miatello in litt.) (Table 2 [see Appendix]).
Based on Upland Sandpiper numbers (Tables 1 and 2 [see Appendix]; Figure 8B), the following areas and localities should be considered in future conservation initiatives:
•   Zone I, particularly the surroundings of Laguna Mar Chiquita and Bañados del Río Dulce in Cordoba Province, Argentina. This site has protection status as a Provincial Reserve, and is also a WHSRN Site, Ramsar Site, and an Important Bird Area (IBA CO07).
•   Zone II, particularly the grasslands of Salto and Artigas Departments in Uruguay (A. Azpiroz in litt., J.M. Venzal in litt., J. Aldabe in litt.).
•   Zone VIII, particularly the Counties of Bahía Blanca, Coronel Rosales, Tornquist, Coronel

Dorrego, Coronel Pringles, and Tres Arroyos in Buenos Aires province, Argentina.



Other zones to be assessed and also considered:

•   Zone IV, particularly the following areas of Argentina: northwest Buenos Aires Province (Counties of General Villegas, America, Carlos Tejedor, Trenque Lauquen, Ameghino and Pinto); northeast La Pampa Province (County of Chapaleufú); and southern C~rdoba Province (from the County of Rufino to the Río Cuarto region) (I. Roesler in litt.).
•   Zone II, particularly the southern portion of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

CONSERVATION THREATS


The greatest threats the Upland Sandpiper faces are loss of habitat and the use of agrochemicals on both the breeding and nonbreeding grounds.

HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION

In North America, changes in ranching and farming practices pose the greatest threats to Upland Sandpiper breeding populations. The conversion of rangeland to row-cropping in the Prairie Pothole Region is probably the greatest threat for nesting sandpipers. In the East, loss and fragmentation of habitat due to increased urbanization and natural forest succession are also substantial threats (Carter 1992). This species has disappeared or declined in portions of the eastern United States (Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois). Frequent cutting of hayfields, usually several times per year, has a substantial adverse impact on nesting sandpipers. In addition, eggs and chicks are vulnerable to mammalian and avian predators; raptors, primarily falcons, pose threats to adults.




WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       25
In Argentina, much of the original natural grassland in the Pampas has been replaced by croplands—mainly wheat, maize, sorghum, soybeans, and pastures like alfalfa (Soriano 1991)— with more than 80% of the initial grasslands being converted (S. Krapovickas pers. comm.). The association of nonbreeding Upland Sandpipers with cultivated lands suggests that this shorebird may actually have benefited from this change in land use, at least within some areas of its main nonbreeding range. This was particularly noted for Paraguay (H. del Castillo in litt.). In other sectors in northwest Uruguay, the species is more frequently observed in natural grasslands than in planted pastures and crops (A. Azpiroz in litt., J. Aldabe in litt.).


SHOOTING AND TRAPPING

Historically, Upland Sandpipers were intensively hunted in North America. For example, in 1890, two game dealers in Boston received over 9,000 Upland Sandpipers for sale (Mackay
1891). From the late 1870s to approximately 1890, some 50,000 to 60,000 Upland Sandpipers were shipped annually from Nebraska (Houston and Bowen 2001). Hunting pressure in North America abated after the passage of Canada’s Migratory Birds Convention Act in 1917 and the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty in 1918 (Houston and Bowen 2001). However, the effects of market hunting may persist to the present. Subsistence hunting was not a major threat to the Upland Sandpiper in Argentina (Canevari and Blanco 1994), but it could have some impact in specific locations in Paraguay (R. Clay in litt.) and in Barbados (Hutt 1991, in Houston and Bowen
2001).



PESTICIDES AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS/TOXIC MATERIALS

The use of insecticides and other agrochemicals associated with cultivation practices has been identified as one of the main threats to the Upland Sandpiper in Argentina (R. Miatello pers comm., P. Michelutti in litt.) and in Paraguay (H. del Castillo in litt.). Specifically, in the case of Swainson’s Hawk (Buteo swainsoni), the use of Monocrotophos to kill grasshoppers in the 1990s resulted in the death of thousands of hawks (Goldstein et al. 1996). In Argentina, dead Upland Sandpipers have been found after the spraying of pesticides in southern C~rdoba Province (S. Salvador, in A.G. Di Giacomo in litt.), but the real impact to the population is not known. In Santa Fe Province, spraying of agrochemicals is thought to be one of the potential causes of the species’ decline in this region (M. De La Peña in litt.).

Detrimental effects have not been documented for Upland Sandpipers on the breeding grounds despite the use of insecticides such as Guthion® there, but this has not been adequately studied. It is unclear whether insecticide use might affect invertebrate abundance or be toxic to fledglings or adults, and should be studied.


HUMAN DISTURBANCE

Farming practices, such as haying, can adversely affect Upland Sandpipers, but this is probably not a substantial problem in most of the species’ breeding range. Human activities in Paraguay have been mentioned as a threat to nonbreeding Upland Sandpipers, but without identifying specific disturbances (R. Clay in litt.).


CONSERVATION STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS HABITAT PROTECTION

Protect large tracts of suitable or potential nesting habitat. The Prairie Pothole Joint Venture has adopted the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan’s goal of increasing the Upland Sandpiper population size to 126,900 birds, or approximately 63,500 pairs (Casey et al. 2005). If Upland Sandpiper rely primarily on blocks of 100 hectares, and there are approximately 4 pairs per 100 hectares (or 1 pair per 25 hectares), then nearly 1.6 million hectares of suitable grassland habitat would need to be protected. The Upper Mississippi–Great Lakes Joint Venture has a population target of 45,000 pairs, but has estimated that only 225,000 hectares of preferred habitat would be necessary to achieve this goal (Potter et al. 2007). This habitat total implies a calculation of 1 pair per 5 hectares, or 20 pairs per 100 hectares. This habitat estimate, therefore, might be too low, and worth reconsideration.

Maintain grazed lands on private cattle ranches. Upland Sandpipers are abundant in grazed native prairies, many of which are found on large private ranches in the Prairie Pothole Region. Given the variability in cattle prices, private ranches are frequently obliged to diversify their operations, often by planting row crops. Because crop agriculture receives federal subsidies whereas ranching does not, there is considerable financial incentive to plow the prairie for row crops. Any program that helps ranchers to keep grazing cattle in a way that is beneficial to Upland Sandpipers should be encouraged. This could be accomplished through acquisition of



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       27
grassland easements, assistance with water projects, and grazing systems. The same concerns are also true for South America.

Manage public grasslands for birds. Public grasslands on federal and state protected areas in Illinois and throughout the Midwestern states should be managed in a way that benefits nesting Upland Sandpipers and other grassland-dependent birds. Management on public lands
can partially compensate for loss and deterioration of habitat on private land (Kirsch and Higgins

1976).

Provide incentives for private grasslands conservation. Incentive-based or subsidy programs should be developed to encourage or assist private landowners in maintaining large grassland pastures, especially in regions where the species has declined or where the breeding population is not increasing (i.e., St. Lawrence Plains and the Northeast in general).



HABITAT MANAGEMENT

Breeding Season
High-quality nesting habitat should be established within grasslands by maintaining a mosaic of vegetation heights through appropriate grazing, prescribed burning, or mowing (Carter
1992). The intensity of grazing and the frequency of burning or mowing will vary over the species’ geographic range and will accommodate differences in successional stages of the vegetation. More detailed habitat-management recommendations include the following:

Burning: Prescribed burning of fields, rotating every 2 to 4 years, is recommended depending on precipitation patterns. To maintain native mixed grasslands, Kirsch and Higgins (1976) recommended rotational burning at 3-year intervals. Higgins’ studies on grassland management in North Dakota (1986) suggest that, when averaged over the subsequent three to four growing seasons, fall burns may enhance nest success more than spring burns. Grasslands managed by fire need periods of rest to allow for vegetation re-growth and some residual cover accumulation. Where possible, burning should be conducted when sandpipers are not actively nesting. Only part of large units (greater than 75 hectares) should be burned in any year (Jones and Vickery 1997).







WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       28
Grazing: Moderate grazing can provide optimal nesting habitat. The appropriate grazing intensity will need to be determined for each region, but should ultimately result in a mosaic of grass heights.

Hay Fields: Grasses in nesting fields should be short (10–20 centimeters) at the time of spring arrival. In the Northeast, mowing every 1 to 3 years usually maintains grass in this height range each spring (Jones and Vickery 1997). All haying operations in nesting fields should be curtailed until after chicks have hatched in mid-July.

Airfields: At airfields, grasses should be maintained at a height of 20 to 30 centimeters in areas not directly adjacent to runways or taxiways. Mowing of these taller-grass areas should be restricted during the nesting and brood-rearing period (1 May to 15 July) to reduce the potential for nest destruction and mortality of incubating adults or flightless young. Maintaining such taller-grass areas provides nesting habitat for Upland Sandpipers, discourages large concentrations of social flocking birds, and reduces overall mowing costs.



Nonbreeding Season
Partnerships with national and local authorities and with governmental institutions should promote best cultivation practices among farmers. Such practices would involve reducing the use of agrochemicals and adjusting grassland burning regimes to benefit Upland Sandpipers and
other grassland bird species in agro-ecosystems.

Partnerships with private landowners should promote native grassland conservation. Additionally, national and local campaigns should be developed to raise awareness about the importance of conserving Upland Sandpiper populations and habitats. Target groups would include farmers and other relevant landowners or managers, school children, and the general public.



RESEARCH AND MONITORING NEEDS


Upland Sandpipers have been studied on the breeding grounds for many years, and this research continues to the present. Very little is known about Upland Sandpiper migrations and staging areas, however. The species has received relatively little quantitative study in South




WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       29
America during the nonbreeding season. The primary research needs are presented below, categorized by lifecycle stages and in no particular priority order therein:


RESEARCH

Range-wide

•    Determine whether breeding populations are discrete in both the breeding and 

nonbreeding seasons. 

•   Determine whether Upland Sandpipers in the Midwestern United States have a different nonbreeding range than those in the East.

•   Preliminary observations from different localities within the Upland Sandpiper’s main nonbreeding range (MNR) suggest a decline in numbers. Therefore, assess the species’ current population status and trends overall, and determine which threats and factors are contributing to this possible decline.

Breeding Range

•   Refine grassland management techniques such as grazing, prescribed burning, and mowing for each major ecological region in order to maintain high-quality nesting habitat throughout the species’ breeding range.

•   Determine whether the breeding populations are genetically distinct.

•   Expand the use and development of spatial models to identify high-quality Upland

Sandpiper breeding habitat.

•   Continue, as well as expand, efforts to monitor Upland Sandpiper populations. The Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) provides a reasonable method for monitoring Upland Sandpipers in the upper Midwest (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas) where the species is quite common; the BBS is less valuable in areas where sandpipers are less common and more locally distributed. Additional programs, such as the Illinois Species Bird Count, can provide more detailed data regarding population trends in such areas (J. Herkert, pers. comm.).






WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       30

•   In the Midwest, where Upland Sandpipers have traditionally relied on pastures, determine if this species is using additional habitats; if so, determine brood survival in those areas.

•   Determine Upland Sandpiper demography with greater accuracy. For instance, do first- year sandpipers breed? If so, what are the rates of success? How long do Upland Sandpipers live?

Migration

•   Develop more precise knowledge of Upland Sandpiper migration routes, timing, and energetic requirements.

•   Determine if males migrate at different times than females and juveniles.

•   Identify the primary risks during migration. In particular, determine the regularity, source, and significance of Upland Sandpiper mortality during southbound migration in the High Andes of Ecuador.

•   Develop and refine spatial models to identify important migratory stopover sites.

•   Determine the degree and timing of Upland Sandpiper movements in South America. For instance, does this species migrate directly to nonbreeding grounds or are there stopover sites?

•   Identify the main stopover sites used, if any, during migration in South America.


Nonbreeding Range

•   Refine our knowledge of important nonbreeding sites or regions in South America. As with many species, lack of data about Upland Sandpipers in the nonbreeding range prevents the implementation of targeted actions to help conserve them. For instance, important information gaps exist in the Inland Pampa of Argentina (Figure 8, Zone IV). More studies are also needed to assess the size of the nonbreeding population in northern South America, particularly in Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana.

•   Determine if Upland Sandpipers return to the same sites in South America each year.

•   Determine more precisely what habitats Upland Sandpipers use during the nonbreeding season. For instance, we know that nonbreeding Upland Sandpipers are associated with



WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       31
crops, pastures, and natural grasslands, but it is not clear what proportion of the population uses these habitats. It is also unclear how Upland Sandpipers use different crops during this time of year. For instance, does the species undertake local or regional movements to follow the crop cycle? Do alfalfa fields play a key role as nonbreeding habitat for this species?

•   Assess the species’ habitat requirements in relation to cattle management practices in cattle-raising fields.

•   The use of agrochemicals is very likely one of the main threats to nonbreeding Upland Sandpiper. It should be a priority to study and quantify the impacts of agrochemicals on the nonbreeding population.


MONITORING

South America
The highest monitoring priority is in South America. There are no data that identify critical nonbreeding habitats or provide clear population trends. It will be important to develop a randomized sampling protocol that stratifies major habitat types (native grassland, grazed grassland, agricultural crops, etc.). Once identified, these sites should be sampled on a regular basis, ideally as part of a multi-species monitoring program such as the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) or as an expansion of the Neotropical Waterbird Census. In the breeding season, the Breeding Bird Survey provides an adequate measure of population trends in the Midwest, but this system should be expanded into areas that are not adequately monitored, including the blueberry barrens of Maine and New Brunswick.

Management Programs
Assessing the effectiveness of active management programs should be a high priority. As new information becomes available, it could be communicated via the U.S. Geological Survey’s management practices document (http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/literatr/grasbird/ upsa/upsa.htm). Information on regional fledging success and characterization of nesting cover will be important for making local management recommendations.







WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       32
Environmental Contaminants
Determining if and how agrochemicals adversely affect the Upland Sandpiper, both on breeding and nonbreeding grounds, is very important. Conducting coordinated studies in North America and South America on potential chemical accumulation and the potential effects should be a high priority.

CONSERVATION ACTION TIMELINE


The recommended priority actions for the conservation of Upland Sandpipers in the
Western Hemisphere are:

By 2008, permanently protect an additional 5,000 hectares of native prairie in landscapes identified as having high densities of Upland Sandpipers in the core of the species’ breeding range. Continue annually until at least a total of 100,000 hectares are protected.

By 2008, initiate a research project(s) to determine the causes and magnitude of Upland
Sandpiper mortality occurring in the high Andes of Ecuador.

By 2008, develop a system for monitoring nonbreeding Upland Sandpiper populations through a hemispheric-scale cooperative network, using the most current survey techniques and occupancy models.

By 2009, convene an Upland Sandpiper conservation and management workshop with participation from federal, state, and local agencies, agricultural and ranching landowners/managers, and other relevant science and conservation organizations (U.S. and Latin American) to assess current land management practices in light of the species’ population declines and breeding-range needs.

By 2009, design and implement research project(s) to discern nonbreeding Upland Sandpiper’s use of agricultural/ranching habitat. In particular, study its use of different crops in relation to the crop cycles, and its habitat requirements in relation to how cattle-raising fields are managed.

By 2009, design and implement a program to assess and monitor the impact of agrochemicals on nonbreeding Upland Sandpiper population in the Pampas of Argentina.

By 2009, initiate a research project(s) to quantify the importance of habitats to Upland Sandpipers in lesser-known areas/regions of its main nonbreeding range. Focal areas could include:
•    Zone II (Brazil): southern portion of the Rio Grande do Sul State.
•    Zone IV (Argentina): northwest of Buenos Aires Province [counties of General Villegas, America, Carlos Tejedor, Trenque Lauquen, Ameghino and Pinto]; northeast of La Pampa Province [county of Chapaleufú]; and south of C~rdoba Province.
•    Zone V (Argentina): northern tip of Buenos Aires Province and south of Santa Fe
Province.

By 2010, initiate a research project(s) to determine important demographic parameters related to the age when Upland Sandpipers first breed; further determine nest success of inexperienced breeders versus experienced adults.

By 2010, determine which factors are limiting the Upland Sandpiper population: In particular, is population growth limited by inadequate reproductive success, high rates of mortality in migration, or low survival rates on the nonbreeding grounds? In South America, how does the use of agrochemicals affect the species’ mortality rate within the Pampas?

By 2010, refine knowledge about Upland Sandpiper nonbreeding areas in southern South America by better identifying and quantifying key sites, and assessing main threats to the species. Focal areas would include:
•    Zone I (Argentina): modified Espinal, particularly the surroundings of Laguna Mar Chiquita and Bañados del Río Dulce.
•    Zone II (Uruguay): grasslands of Salto and Artigas Departments.
•    Zone VIII (Argentina): southern Pampas, particularly the Counties of Bahía Blanca, Coronel
Rosales, Tornquist, Coronel Dorrego, Coronel Pringles and Tres Arroyos.

By 2010, initiate a research project(s) to determine whether the three geographically concentrated populations of breeding Upland Sandpipers differ genetically or are panmictic.

By 2010, refine and expand the system for monitoring breeding Upland Sandpipers in the U.S. Northeast, Illinois, and Oregon, where the species is inadequately sampled by the Breeding Bird Survey.

By 2010, using satellite radio technology, determine the Upland Sandpiper’s migration routes to and from its nonbreeding range in South America, as well as the timing of its movements between sites within South America.

By 2012, convene two workshops (one in North America, another in South America) between national and local governmental representatives, agricultural-related authorities, farmers, and local environmental organizations to address the use of agrochemicals and their impact on Upland Sandpiper populations. Attendees will discern the best cultivation practices, and develop mechanisms for implementing them.

By 2015, following genetic studies conducted on breeding populations, determine if the
southern and north-eastern South American nonbreeding populations are genetically related, and which breeding areas they are using.

By 2015, determine the age structure for Upland Sandpipers, particularly how long the species breeds and lives.









WHSRN – Upland Sandpiper Conservation Plan v1.1, February 2010                                                                       34
EVALUATION


Conservation actions should be evaluated separately for each part of the Upland Sandpiper’s year round requirements. Breeding-season actions should be linked to increased population and productivity, which should increase by > 1.0% annually in the Midwest and Northeast. Once the degree and regularity of Upland Sandpiper mortality in the Andes is accurately determined, and if this point of mortality is found to be a limiting factor, actions in
this region need to demonstrate reduced mortality. Efforts in South America should also result in improved monitoring protocols and the identification of preferred habitats. If toxicity studies demonstrate detrimental affects to Upland Sandpipers, efforts to reduce use of agrochemicals need to show declines in chemical residue and mortality of birds in agro-ecosystems during the nonbreeding season.
