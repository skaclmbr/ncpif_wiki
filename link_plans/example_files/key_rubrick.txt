Rubrick for developing key slugs

Note that an individual entity may occur more than once in the list, but must have the same key! For example, Cooper's hawk may be listed as Cooper's hawk, coopers hawk, accipiter cooperii, but all of these terms should be associated with the same key value -> coopers-hawk.

In General:
-the key should be clear - use a slugified plain text version of the item when possible
-the key should be hierarchical (elements should be from larger to smaller context). If done properly, sorting by key will be in a natural organization


Species:
-slugify common name: spp-coopers-hawk = Cooper's hawk
-remove all punctuation

WAP Habitats:
-slugify WAP Habitat + 1 letter region: 
	Piedmont Dry Coniferous Woodlands = ncwap-hab-p-dry-coniferous-woodlands
	Mountain Spruce Fir Forest = ncwap-hab-m-spruce-fir-forest
-be sure to include region letter regardless of whether the habitat occurs in more than one region

WAP Priorities:
-slugify 'ncwap' + p-type + 'priority' + unique number:
	"Focus survey priorities on species believed to be declining, at risk, or exclusively dependent on the rare spruce-fir forest communities (e;g; red crossbill, brown creeper, black-capped chickadee, rock vole, rock shrew, northern flying squirrel, Weller's salamander, pigmy  salamander);" , survey priority #1 = ncwap-pri-s-1

SEGAP Habitats:
-slugify 'segap' + habitat class : 
	East Gulf Coastal Plain Maritime Forest = segap-east-gulf-coastal-plain-maritime-forest
